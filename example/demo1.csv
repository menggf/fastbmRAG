6011,35012617,2022,Journal of ovarian research,4.0,Predictive factors of endometriosis progression into ovarian cancer.,"In recent years, the endometriosis has overcome a noteworthy renaissance in the recognition of its potential. In certain patients, a demonstrable malignant progression of ectopic foci leading to development of ovarian cancer is seen. The knowledge of endometriosis overthrow background into endometriosis associated ovarian cancer is of paramount importance for selection of patients at risk. The goal of the presented study was to review a malignant potential of the endometriosis and to specify predictive factors of endometriosis progression into ovarian cancer. Altogether 189 patients were included in the study. Conventional cytogenetics as well as measurement of transcriptional activity of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) and HIF1A (HIF1-α) genes were prospectively studied in 60 endometriosis patients and 50 control group patients. The retrospective histopathological analysis was performed in 19 endometriosis associated ovarian cancer patients and 60 patients with histologically confirmed endometriosis.|Five endometriosis patients showed a deviation from normal cytogenetics finding without affecting of their phenotype. In 6 cases of endometriosis associated ovarian cancer ectopic endometrium was not confirmed. The remaining 13 cases demonstrated either benign or atypical endometriosis or even structures of borderline carcinoma. Atypical endometriosis was histologically confirmed in 20% of 60 endometriosis patients. Determination of gene expression (CTNNB1, HIF1A) formed two subgroups. Transcriptionally incipient endometriosis subgroup with insignificant genes expression compared to control group. In transcriptionally evident endometriosis subgroup were genes expressions significantly higher compared to control group (p < 0.01) as well as transcriptionally incipient endometriosis subgroup (p < 0.05).|Significant structural abnormalities of chromosomes are not included in genetic rigging of endometriosis patients. Atypical endometriosis represents a histopathologically detectable intermediate of endometriosis progression. Determination of genes expression CTNNB1 and HIF1A helps to allocate risk patients with endometriosis where more precise management is needed.","['In recent years, the endometriosis has overcome a noteworthy renaissance in the recognition of its potential. Today, it is understood as a clinically complex syndrome characterized by chronic hormone-dependent inflammation with notable proliferative potential. About 10% of the reproductive age women suffer from this disease and a variety of clinical symptoms are known. In certain patients, a demonstrable malignant progression of ectopic foci leading to development of ovarian cancer (OC) is seen.', 'The large histological variability of OC presupposes more tissues as an initial structure for the process of ovarian carcinogenesis [1]. In the ovary itself, ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) constitutes the main structure which either accumulates mutations or undergoes metaplasia to the m""""ullerian epithelium. In both cases, the process of carcinogenesis takes place in cortical inclusion cyst (CIC) after incorporation of pathological tissue. Another source of tissue for OC represents an ectopic m""""ullerian epithelium transported and incorporated into CIC. This is the case of endosalpingiosis as a potential source of serous borderline ovarian tumour [2, 3]. The fallopian tube plays an important role in process of OC development. Precursors, such as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) or papillary tubal hyperplasia (PTH) can locally progress or more often are adhered to carcinogenesis more favourable environment of OSE. Finally, retrograde endometrial reflux adhered to the OSE is involved in the development of some carcinomas, type I (Table 1). Inflamed stroma and mutations containing ectopic endometrium have better conditions to progress in more propitious microenvironment of the ovary [4]. This fact confirmed also finding that deep infiltrating endometriosis although containing the same changes in stroma and epithelium progress into carcinoma sporadically [5].', 'The connections of biologically different tissues have been already confirmed as locus minoris resistentiae to the carcinogenesis initiation in human body (gastro-esophageal or ano-rectal junction). The connection of the fallopian tube and the ovary, tubo-ovarian junction as well as the process of ovulation in its vicinity represent an impeccable interplay to start the formation of pathogenic clone of cells.', 'The term endometriosis associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) has didactic dimension and in clinical practice there assign mainly endometrioid ovarian cancer (EOC) and clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC). Not every EAOC has histologically proven endometriosis in its structure. Based on this findings, in can be assumed that endometriosis is a precursor of only certain EAOC. Malignant reversal of endometriosis is an uncommon event, counting for less than 1%. Question which endometriotic lesion tends to progress into carcinoma remains unanswered.', 'Common features typical for endometriosis and cancer cells, i.e. to evade apoptosis, ability of stem cells as well as angiogenic potential were described. Haemolysis, a process typical for ectopic endometrium is strongly associated with oxidation. The compounds included in process are extracellular free haemoglobin, heme, and iron derivatives. These components were abundantly proven in peritoneal fluid as well as in fluid of endometriomas during menstruation [6]. Oxidation processes in endometriosis deposits result in the accumulation of DNA mutations that with the help of immune system lead either to cell death or formation of pathogenic clone of cells [7].', 'Despite the development of molecular genetic techniques, classical - conventional cytogenetics is an essential part of both, basic and advanced genetic testing. By the examination the numerical as well as structural chromosomal aberrations are detectable. Based on literature, cytogenetic examinations of endometriosis patients brought often discrepant results.', 'Based on histopathological criteria a benign (typical) and atypical endometriosis (AE) can be defined, with AE significantly associated in EAOC [8]. Two degrees of atypia were in tissue of AE described. Cellular atypia (cytological) indicating a changes in epithelial layer including hyperchromasia and pleomorphism. Structural atypia (hyperplasia) represent a hyperplastic changes similar to eutopic endometrium (simplex or complex hyperplasia with or without cellular atypia) [9]. Most studies refer AE as a tissue containing both, cellular and structural atypia. However cytological atypia are mostly in cancer free patients seen, whereas structural atypia are found particularly in OC patients [10].', 'Different clinical potential of both atypia confirmed the studies of COX-2, Ki-67 and BAF250a. Immunohistochemical COX-2 positivity was significantly higher in benign endometriosis (BE) comparing to AE. The same phenomenon was seen when compared cytological versus structural AE. Four time higher COX-2 expression was in cytological AE confirmed. This conclusions predict cytological AE to reactive changes. Ki-67 positivity was significantly higher in tissue of structural atypia confirming greater proliferative potential when compared to cytological atypia. Comparable results were also in case of AE versus BE seen. ARID1A mutation phenotypically leading to decrease in protein BAF250a represents an initial genetic change of endometriosis overthrow. BAF250a decrease was confirmed in both, OC as well as AE. When compare structural atypia versus cytological atypia of AE, lower BAF250a expressions were in patients with structural atypia seen [10].', 'Several studies have confirmed the presence of both, BE and AE in EAOC patients [10-12]. The tissue of EAOC can be also without endometriosis, or with gradual transition from BE to AE and borderline carcinoma (BOC). In case of AE the structural atypia are more common [10]. Currently accepted histopathological criteria for AE include features of eosinophilic cytoplasm, large hyperchromatin or pale nuclei with moderate to marked pleomorphism, increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and cell aggregation.', 'Catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1) called also -catenin represents a protein encoded by the gene CTNNB1. It is involved in the process of carcinogenesis of many cancers. Mainly in the regulation of gene transcription as well as cell adhesion. Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway accompanied by CTNNB1 mutation induces a process of ambient fibrotization [13]. In addition, the potentiation of proliferation as well as an increase in implantation ability or invasion is recorded [14]. CTNNB1 mutation was detected in many cancers including ovarian [15] or endometrial type as well as in endometriosis [16]. The regulation of -catenin is provided by two processes. It is by -catenin destructive complex and partially also by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein which is encoded by tumor suppressor APC gene. The APC gene mutation is in several cancer seen, significantly in colorectal carcinoma.', 'Both, CTNNB1 mutation as well as Wnt signaling pathway activation was in ectopic endometrium confirmed. The strong association between Wnt pathway activation and fibrosis was suggested. Involvement of Wnt activation into this process represents an initial submolecular change in ectopic endometrium. Finally, intensive expression of CTNNB1 was even in eutopic endometrium during menstruation observed.', 'Protein hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1) presents a subunit of transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), encoded by gene HIF1A. This protein is involved in the processes of cell metabolism regulation, in particular its response to hypoxia (Fig 1). Hypoxia represents a condition important for angiogenesis, physiologically seen in embryo or as the part of pathological process in tumour tissue. Hypoxia inhibits HIF-1 degradation leading to its translocation into cell nucleus and subsequent activation of the expression of various genes as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The result of these processes is pro-angiogenic potential of the tissue. Thus the main function of HIF-1 is regulation of VEGF, secondly it contributes to the potentiation of tumour-induced immunosuppression. HIF-1 regulation is also performed by PI3K which provides an activation of Akt signaling pathway. The PI3K/Akt pathway is an intracellular signaling pathway involved in several processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis or glucose metabolism. PI3K activation phosphorylates and activates Akt. Akt phosphorylates different substrates, including mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) which activation was in case of OC seen (Fig 2). In this scenario the decrease in level of mTOR, HIF-1 and VEGF is the goal of the targeted therapy for OC. Many cancers show overactive Akt pathway resulting in apoptosis reduction or proliferation. Significantly higher expression of HIF1A gene was seen in ectopic endometrium comparing to normal endometrium [17].', 'The relationship between level of HIF-1 and CTNNB1 and the potential of endometriosis malignization was not studied yet.', 'The goal of the presented study was to review a malignant potential of the endometriosis by usage of three methods and to specify predictive factors of endometriosis progression into OC.', 'Conventional cytogenetics was used to reveal raw genetic changes in endometriosis patients. Histopathological analysis evaluated a presence of AE in endometriosis patients as well as presence of different type of endometriosis in EAOC patients. By the PCR examination of the mentioned genes we were trying to select a high risk patients with endometriosis where the probability of progression into cancer is significantly seen.', 'Altogether 189 patients were included in the study. Prospectively conventional cytogenetics as well as PCR examination of the genes HIF1A and CTNNB1 was performed in 60 patients with endometriosis. In addition, to compare results of PCR examination both genes were assessed in 50 healthy patients as well. Retrospective histopathological analysis was done in 79 patients. There were 60 patients with endometriosis and 19 patients with EAOC.', 'Basic genetic examination, conventional cytogenetics is performed by banding technique which creates a patterns of horizontal bands on the examined chromosomes. The most commonly used technique include G-band forming bright (euchromatin, active regions of chromosomes) and dark (heterochromatin, inactive genes) horizontal bands along chromosomes. By the examination structural and numerical aberration of the chromosomes can be seen. Cytogenetic examination can be performed from peripheral blood, fetal cells, but also from vital tissue.', 'Prospectively 60 reproductive age patients (20-56 years, average age 36.9 years) with histologically proven endometriosis were assessed by this method. In all the patients a peripheral blood was for the conventional cytogenetics used. The characteristics, i.e. surgical approach, perioperative finding, type of surgery as well as other findings are shown in Table 2. Peripheral venous blood (3-5 ml) was after harvesting transported into the laboratory till 60 min. The process of tissue preparation composed from three phases which is well known and has been described in detail:Lymphocytes cultivationPreparation of cytogenetic sectionsStaining of cytogenetic sections', 'Altogether 79 patients were retrospectively examined in this section, i.e. 60 patients with endometriosis and 19 with EAOC.', ""During the years 2007-2014 from 178 OC patients were 19 patients categorized as EAOC. Inclusion criteria were histology of EOC or CCOC. The age of the patients was 43-68 years with average age 52.36 years. Five patients were presented with bulky tumor and average diameter more than 11 cm. Excepts in 3 patients the CA125 was examined preoperatively and the average value was 250 IU/ml. All the patients' characteristics are listed in Table 3."", ""Retrospectively selected 60 patients with ovarian endometriosis were histopathologically analyzed. The average age of the included patients was 33.4 years (19-62 years). All the patients' characteristics are listed in Table 4."", 'The criteria for diagnosis of AE were already published [18] and this classification was used for definition of AE in selected patients. Thus the patients with endometriosis were classified either as a BE or AE. While in EAOC patients the possibilities of histopathological findings were as follows:EAOC without endometriosisEAOC with BEEAOC with AEEAOC with histologically proven gradual development from BE through BOC to EAOC.To avoid a subjective evaluation all the slides in both groups were examined by one pathologist. The main specialization of the pathologist is focused to endometriosis and ovarian pathology.', 'A prospective PCR analysis of selected genes was done in 110 patients.', 'The experimental group (EG) consisted of 60 patients with histologically confirmed endometriosis where conventional cytogenetics was also performed (Table 2). The average age of included patients was 36.9 years (20-56 years) and the endometriosis patients were free of other diseases.', 'The control group (CG) was made up of 50 blood donor patients. The inclusion criteria were negative family history of oncological disease in last two generation, negative medical examination, blood findings within reference range including oncomarker CA125 and CEA. Every patient from CG had vaginal ultrasonography with negative result. The average age was 34.2 years (21-46 years).', 'The real time PCR method was used to investigate evidence of expression changes on mRNA levels. Four analyses of each gene, per person, in EG and CG were performed. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral whole venous blood using a RNA blood Mini isolation kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was quantified and purity was assessed using the Nanodrop(R) 3300 (Thermo Scientific). Reverse transcription from mRNA to cDNA was achieved using RevertAid Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Merck) with specific reverse primers for each gene. After the definition of reaction conditions for SensiMixTM SYBR(R) NoROX kit ran the amplification of the specific gene HIF1A and -catenin for 30 cycles (94 ^0C 5 min, 94 ^0C 15 s., 60 ^0C 20 s. and 72 ^0C 25 s.), using appropriate primer sequences in the thermocycler LightCycler(R) 480 Instrument II (Roche Life Science). Normalization of the results was performed using housekeeping gene HGPRT and GAPDH. Numerical quantification of changes in expression levels was evaluated using the LightCycler(R) 480 Software, Version 1.5., where were confirmed Ct values corresponded with the midpoint of logarithmic amplification. Relative mRNA concentrations were calculated with respect to reference RNAs and inter-class fold changes computed using the 2^-Ct function.', 'In order to minimize the impact of variability in the experimental data, all samples were measured four times. For the statistical evaluation One-Way ANOVA Student-Newmann-Keuls test was used. Data is presented as mean percent +/- SD. Statistical analysis was processed by the program GraphPad INSTAT.', 'From 60 endometriosis patients were 55 identified with normal karyotype 46,XX. 5 patients (8.3%) showed cytogenetic deviation from the physiological finding.', ""Three of them were concluded as heteromorphisms - variants of human karyotypes without affecting of patients' phenotype. Such non-aberrant karyotype changes affect those parts of the chromosomes whose length or molecular structure varies within a population. All the deviations were detected in acrocentric chromosomes - group D (chromosomes 13, 14, 15) and group G (chromosomes 21, 22):chromosome 14 satellite duplication (46,XX, 14pss)absence of chromosome 13 satellite (46,XX, 13 ps-)the association between group D and G chromosomes - chromosomal configuration with potential of chromosomes withdrawal during next division and forming of numeric aberration."", 'In the rest of pathological findings - in two patients, the numerical abnormality with manifestation in the mosaic form was confirmed:45,X(5)/46,XX(45) - in five mitosis the karyotype 45,X was seen. The rest of mitosis was with karyotype 46,XX. In this case Turner mosaic was confirmed.46,XX,+mar(2)/46,XX(98) - in two mitoses a marker chromosome from group C was seen. The case was concluded as the mosaic form of X chromosome trisomy (superfemale) with normal phenotype.', 'By comparison of the results with clinical characteristics of the patients the association was not observed. The patients containing a cytogenetic deviations were diagnosed with not extensive endometriosis. In three of them an ovarian endometrioma and in two of them endometriosis of sacrouterine ligament was seen. Complete resections were in all patients performed.', 'Altogether 19 (10.67%) of 178 OC patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2014 were confirmed as EAOC. From all EAOC patients 12 of them (63.15%) were EOC and 7 (36.85%) CCOC.', 'Overall in 19 EAOC patients the endometriosis was not seen in 6 (31.57%) patients. In 3 patients (15.78%) the tissue of BE was confirmed while AE in 4 EAOC patients (21.08%). In other 6 patients the transition from BE through BOC structures to carcinoma tissue was identified.', 'When we checked for EOC (12 patients), 3 (25%) of them were without endometriosis, 2 (16.66%) with BE, 3 (25%) with AE and finally 4 (33.34%) EOC patients had transition from BE to cancer through BOC in their histology.', 'From seven CCOC patients, 3 (42.85%) were free of endometriosis, both BE as well as AE was confirmed in 1 patient (14.28%). Two (28.59%) CCOC patients had except carcinoma cells also BE and BOC in histology finding.', 'From 60 ovarian endometriosis patients were 12 (20%) patients classified with AE while the rest 48 (80%) showed only BE finding (Fig 3).', 'The analysis of HIF1A and CTNNB1 (mRNA level) in CG patients (n = 50) represented a reference value compared with the findings in the EG patients (n = 60).', 'The patients in EG were regarding the level of gene transcription divided into two subgroups. Transcriptionally incipient endometriosis (TIE), with 26 patients showed increased level of gene mRNA for both, HIF1A and CTNNB1 compared to CG however significantly lower than in second group. This group - transcriptionally evident endometriosis (TEE), contained 34 patients from EG where the level of mRNA genes (HIF1A and CTNNB1) were significantly higher compared to the both, CG as well as TIE (Table 5).', 'HIF1A expressions in TIE group (median 1.21) were increased without significance when compared to CG (median 1.00). However TEE group expressions (median 1.563) were significantly higher compared to CG patients (p < 0.01) as well as TIE patients (p < 0.05) (Fig 4).', 'The similar phenomenon was also in the assessment of CTNNB1 seen. Into TIE group (median 1.094) were selected patients with increased expression comparing to CG (median 1.00) but without statistical significance. While significantly increased expressions compared to CG (p < 0.01) as well as TIE (p < 0.05) were seen in the rest of the patients included into TEE group (median 1.499) (Fig 5).', 'The endometriosis was solidly confirmed as the precursor of certain portion of EAOC. Relatively low incidence of endometriosis overthrow makes difficult to define the predictive factors of this process. Tubo-ovarian junction plays a crucial role in process of malignant ovarian transformation even in the case of endometriosis. Inflamed stroma together with mutated alleles of the epithelial component is incorporated into CIC where due to the favorable environment a malignant transformation of endometriosis occurs [4]. The same microscopic changes are also in deep infiltrated endometriosis seen however malignant overthrow is rare [5]. In this direction ovarian endometriomas have due to their close connection to the ovaries the highest probability to progress into EAOC. The DNA alterations in endometriomas originate from permanent oxidative stress inside. Significantly higher iron ions concentration in endometriotic cysts was confirmed when compare to non-endometriotic cyst. Higher iron concentration was also in CCOC tissue seen, although the level did not reach the amount measured in endometriotic cysts [19]. Following this parameters the endometriosis patients included in presented study for histopathological examination were only with endometriomas. While cytogenetic and experimental PCR study was done in the patients with different types of endometriosis.', ""The development of genetics in the last decades has significantly influenced the focus of the study of various diseases, including endometriosis. Until 1997, conventional cytogenetics was predominant in genetic studies in endometriosis patients. Cytogenetics examinations over the last 20 years yielded discrepant results [20, 21], although the common feature can be defined as the absence of gross chromosome abnormalities. Conventional cytogenetics did not confirm typical chromosomal structural changes which are common for patient with endometriosis [22, 23]. Opposite conclusions were obtained by the studies applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Mainly monosomy, structural aberration or presence of recurrent gene copies increasing clonality potential were confirmed and predominantly chromosomes 1, 16 and 17 were affected [24, 25]. It is well known fact that somatic mutations of chromosome 17 are often seen in process of ovarian carcinogenesis [26]. Three patients of presented study with heteromorphisms - variants of human karyotypes had the aberrations without affecting of patients' phenotype. Although the changes are benign the karyotype can be instable leading to the problems in meiotic division. All the changes were seen in the group of chromosomes D and G. The association of group D and G chromosomes can affect the division leading to numerical aberration. From the presented results it is possible to support the conclusion that usage of conventional cytogenetics did not reveal structural abnormalities in karyotype of endometriosis patients."", 'The switchover between endometriosis and ovarian cancer through carcinogenesis presupposes common morphological coherence. An extensive effort has been made to define morphological precursor of endometriosis overthrow. The initial concept was presented by Sampson in 1925 [27]. Later on the criteria have been extended by Scott in 1953 [28]. The group of borderline carcinomas defined WHO in 1971. Despite of logical context of the development of BE through mild cell atypia (cytological atypia) as the consequence of the inflammatory process to structural atypia (hyperplasia) in cases of AE, the criteria for definition of AE remain controversial and widely discussed. The chronic inflammatory changes in endometriomas lead to metaplastic reaction of the epithelium. The changes are diagnosed as benign and they have no clinical impact. Most probably they represent an early changes starting the process of AE formation. Nowadays widely accepted criteria of AE include structural changes as mentioned earlier (Fig 6). Generally, not specified endometriosis patients, with all types of endometriosis, the incidence of AE is reported to be 8-10%. Higher incidence of AE in endometriosis patients was seen in presented study. 20% of studied histology showed signs of atypia. Reported increased incidence may be caused by types of patients. Due to the close connection with the ovaries only endometriomas were studied and not different types of endometriosis. Detailed analysis of patients with AE confirmed the patients with long-term history of disease, advanced finding during surgery and higher age in AE patients (39.8) when compare to patients with BE (31.8). The patients with long-term history as well as large endometriomas (> 9 cm) have been already confirmed at higher risk for progression and are indicated to stricter observation [29, 30].', 'The frequency of endometriosis overthrow is reported to be 0.3-0.8% [30]. The appearance of AE increases in case of OC patients. Similar phenomenon confirmed Niguez Sevilla with colleagues as well. 8.8% of AE was seen in cancer free patients however in EAOC patients the AE was confirmed in 34.6% [10]. In our study AE was seen in 21.08% of EAOC patients and most of them were with EOC histology (25%), lesser in CCOC patients (14.28%). Slightly different results of AE appearance in EOC and CCOC patients were published. 23% of EOC patients and 36% of CCOC patients were with a presence of AE in their histology [19, 30]. Generally the endometriosis was seen in 68.43% EAOC patients including benign, atypical type or benign endometriosis with BOC structures. EOC patients revealed 75% cases with endometriosis while CCOC patients 57.14%.', 'After 1953 many authors described in EAOC the transition starting from benign endometriosis to AE and BOC. When we checked this group, 31.57% EOAC patients in histology showed endometriosis with BOC, in EOC 33.34% and in CCOC 28.59%. This correspondences with literature. EAOC may have in their histology BE, AE or BE with BOC but also it can be without endometriosis structures [12]. The stepwise development containing endometriosis as well as structures of BOC was in 25% EAOC patients confirmed [10]. Following the results, the presence of AE in histology represents a significant risk factor and predisposes to more precise observation of the patient.', 'Wei with colleagues observed the presence of endometriosis in EAOC patients in younger women, average 45 years [30]. This average decreases mainly the CCOC patients while EOC patients tend to incease it. When we checked our results the average age of CCOC patients was 49.8 years and EOC 53.8 years. Surprisingly the average age in both groups, i.e. EOC and CCOC was lower in endometriosis free patients. The EOC patients without endometriosis were with average age 52.6 years while in patients with endometriosis the average age was 54.2 years. Same phenomenon was in CCOC patients seen. Endometriosis free patients were 47 years old in average while CCOC patients with endometriosis were 52 years old. The patients with EOC histology were captured in earlier stages with more common stepwise development form BE to BOC. On the other hand CCOC patients were diagnosed with more advanced stage with metastases in abdominal cavity.', 'The role of -catenin protein in processes of carcinogenesis have been confirmed in many cancers. The mutations of CTNNB1 gene were seen in pulmonary cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, but also in endometrial and ovarian cancer, including EAOC [15]. Immunohistochemical positivity was confirmed in 61.2% EOC patients but both types of patients, i.e. endometriosis free and EOC with endometriosis showed this result [31]. High incidence, 90%, of CTNNB1 mutation was also in endometrioid borderline carcinoma confirmed [32]. These findings suggest that the CTNNB1 mutations may represent an early change in the process of malignization of some ovarian tumors.', 'The activation of Wnt signaling pathway which also includes a CTNNB1 mutation is connected with the initiation of surrounding fibrotization [13], potentiation of proliferation, implantation or invasion [14]. This process was also in endometriosis confirmed [16]. The extent of the consequences can therefore be logically confronted with the extent of the protein defect.', 'Increased expression of CTNNB1 was seen in presented endometriosis patients of EG when compare to CG. When insignificant increase was detected the patients were closed in TIE group. In the second subgroup of EG, i.e. TEE only significantly increased CTNNB1 expressions were included. When we checked for clinical characteristics of the patients in TEE mainly advanced stage endometriosis patients were seen. Due to the stage of the disease they were often confronted with suboptimal surgery and up to 53% of them had macroscopic residual disease after surgery (Table 6). Taking into account both subgroups we can conclude that CTNNB1 expression correlates with the endometriosis extent in patients.', 'Protein HIF-1 is included in the processes of cell metabolism regulation. Hypoxia leads to decrease in HIF-1 degradation resulting in pro-angiogenic potential as well as potentiation of tumor induced immunosuppression. This situations were in tissues of different carcinomas and endometriosis confirmed. Whereas in endometriomas an angiogenesis is more prominent in the outer capsule of the cyst comparing to inner part [17]. The inner environment of the tumours is characterized by low pH and low oxygen level due to the inadequate circulation. The fast proliferation of the tumor cells leads to the chronic ischemia mainly in central part of the tumours. The result of oxygen depletion is up-regulation of different genes including HIF1A. Finally the VEGF and HIF-1 elevation positively correlate with worse prognosis of OC patients [33]. Therefore the antibodies against VEGF are used as target therapy in clinical practice. The development of HIF1A expressions showed a similar results. In the group TIE only insignificant HIF1A expressions increase were included. They showed increasing about 9.4% when compared to CG. The significant elevation comparing to CG as well as TIE was in the rest of patients seen. They were selected into TEE group with 49.9% elevation comparing to CG. The results are comparable with the previous studies [17, 34] although not every patient showed significant increasing. In the analysis of clinical characteristic of the patients was in the TEE group apparently higher amount of advanced stage patients seen. Also patients with suboptimal surgery or macroscopic residual disease were mainly in this subgroup detected (Table 6).', 'Significant increase in mRNA of both genes HIF1A and CTNNB1 was in TEE seen. Those patients revealed mainly extensive preoperative finding. Bilateral endometrioma, frozen pelvis and peritoneal endometriosis in coincidence with endometriomas were defined as extensive extent. While unilateral endometrioma as well as isolated endometriosis of sacrouterine ligament were defined as unextensive finding.', 'Endometriosis represents a heterogeneous disease from many aspects. The need for the selection of the patients is appropriate and uniform management is obsolete at present. In terms of possibility of endometriosis overthrow the cognition of predictive factors is the basis of the issue. Endometriomas due to their close relationship to ovarian microenvironment are more susceptible to malignant overthrow. Tubo-ovarian junction plays important role in ovarian carcinogenesis, including those containing endometriosis. Specific structural chromosome abnormalities in endometriosis patients predicting its malignant overthrow are not detectable by the conventional cytogenetics. By applying the histopathological criteria defining AE a risk group of endometriosis patients with need for more precise observation can be selected. The patients with long-term history of endometriosis, advanced stage and big endometriomas should be under precise observation. EAOC is more common with endometriosis. EOC are usually less aggressive, slowly progressing and often with detectable histological transition from precursor to invasive carcinoma. Increased expression of mentioned genes is most probably related to the disease progression and characterizes early stages of progression. Determination of genes transcription can help to select a risk group of patients, although other studies are needed.']"
6012,35017684,2022,Journal of human genetics,3.5,APOBEC mediated mutagenesis drives genomic heterogeneity in endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is a benign gynecologic condition, acting as a precursor of certain histological subtypes of ovarian cancers. The epithelial cells of endometriotic tissues and normal uterine endometrium accumulated somatic mutations in cancer-associated genes such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) proto-oncogene. To determine the genomic characteristic of endometriotic epithelial cells and normal uterine endometrium and to identify the predominant mutational process acting on them, we studied the somatic mutation profiles obtained from whole exome sequencing of 14 endometriotic epithelium and 11 normal uterine endometrium tissues and classified them into mutational signatures. We observed that single base substitutions 2/13 (SBS), attributed to Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Enzyme Catalytic Subunit (APOBEC) induced mutagenesis, were significant in endometriotic tissues, but not in the normal uterine endometrium. Additionally, the larger number and wider allele frequency distribution of APOBEC signature mutations, compared to cancer-associated driver mutations in endometriotic epithelium suggested APOBEC mutagenesis as an important source of mutational burden and heterogeneity in endometriosis. Further, the relative risk of enriched APOBEC signature mutations was higher in endometriosis patients who were carriers of APOBEC3A/3B germline deletion, a common polymorphism in East Asians which involves the complete loss of APOBEC3B coding region. Our results illustrate the significance of APOBEC induced mutagenesis in driving the genomic heterogeneity of endometriosis.",[]
6013,35019502,2020,ACS applied bio materials,-0.1,Label-Free Electrochemical Immunosensor Based on One-Step Electrochemical Deposition of AuNP-RGO Nanocomposites for Detection of Endometriosis Marker CA 125.,"Endometriosis is the third most prominent gynecological disorder. Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) is the primary serum marker used for late-stage endometriosis diagnosis and management. Herein, we developed a label-free immunosensor for electrochemical detection of CA 125 for endometriosis blood serum samples. The sensor was fabricated by one-step electrochemical deposition of highly conductive gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposite, via one-step electrochemical deposition. This method involved in situ reduction of HAuCl3 and graphene oxide and increased electrocatalytic performance. Different analytical techniques confirmed the morphology and structure of the AuNP/RGO nanocomposite. In addition, the antibody (Ab) was immobilized on the modified electrode surface through the self-assembly monolayer. The square wave voltammetry method has been utilized to measure the interaction of Ab and antigen (Ag). The as-fabricated sensor demonstrates a dynamic linear range of 0.0001 → 300 U mL-1 and lower limit of detection is 0.000042 U mL-1 toward CA125 detection. The developed sensor provides acceptable stability, high selectivity, and reproducibility. The proposed immunosensor has been applied to the CA 125 detection in endometriosis patient blood samples, and the results confirm the reliability of the as-fabricated sensor that is further associated with the standard ELISA analysis. The AuNP/RGO-based sensor can be used as an excellent tool for future prospective clinical diagnostics applications.",[]
6014,35038312,2022,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",3.8,Gankyrin has a potential role in embryo implantation via activation of STAT3.,"Embryo implantation, a critical step during the mammalian reproductive process, requires normal developing blastocysts and a receptive endometrium. Endometriosis, a common pathologically benign gynecological condition, is associated with decreased fertility and reduced endometrial receptivity. The oncoprotein, Gankyrin, has been associated with endometriosis and endometrial cancer. Here, we examined the role of Gankyrin during the process of embryo implantation and found that Gankyrin expression levels were significantly increased during the mid-secretory phase, but unaffected during the proliferative phase in the human endometrium. Using an in vitro cell adhesion assay to examine the cell adhesion rate of BeWo trophoblast spheroids to Gankyrin knockdown or overexpressing human endometrial carcinoma RL95-2 cells, we demonstrated that the adhesion rate was significantly reduced in Gankyrin-knockdown RL95-2 cells, while overexpression of Gankyrin promoted cell adhesion. Furthermore, we found that the downregulation of Gankyrin inhibited STAT3 activation and subsequent matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) expression, while overexpression led to STAT3 activation and MMP2 expression. In vivo, we found that Gankyrin expression was increased in the endometrium after conception but decreased with the prolongation of gestation time in female mice. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gankyrin in the uterine horn led to a significant reduction in the number of implanted embryos 9 days post-gestation, which was associated with a decrease in p-STAT3 expression and MMP2 transcription. Taken together, our findings indicate that Gankryin has a potential role in embryo implantation via STAT3 activation.",[]
6015,35039492,2022,Cell death discovery,7.0,Endometrial stromal cell ferroptosis promotes angiogenesis in endometriosis.,"Endometriosis, a chronic disorder characterised by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, is associated with iron overload and oxidative stress in the lesion. Although it is well established that iron overload can trigger ferroptosis, the results of previous studies on ferroptosis resistance and ferroptosis in endometriotic lesions are paradoxical. Here, we found that some stromal cells of the cyst walls that were in contact with the cyst fluid underwent ferroptosis. Surprisingly, endometrial stromal cell ferroptosis triggered the production of angiogenic, inflammatory and growth cytokines. In particular, angiogenic cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and interleukin 8 (IL8), promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) vascular formation in vitro. Moreover, we found that inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (p38 MAPK/STAT6) signalling represses VEGFA and IL8 expression when endometrial stromal cells undergo ferroptosis. Notably, VEGFA and IL8 showed localised expression and were significantly upregulated in ectopic lesions compared to control and eutopic endometrium samples from patients with endometriosis. Thus, our study reveals that endometrial stromal cell ferroptosis in the ovarian endometrioma may trigger cytokine secretion and promote angiogenesis of adjacent lesions via paracrine actions to drive the development of endometriosis, providing a rationale for translation into clinical practice and developing drugs for endometriosis.","['Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent disease, characterised by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. It is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting approximately 10% of women of reproductive age, with an estimated 200 million affected individuals worldwide [1]. Among patients with endometriosis, about 40-50% have fertility problems and 50% suffer major pelvic pain, affecting the health and quality of the life of patients and causing a major economic burden [2, 3]. Although it has been generally accepted that the development of endometriosis is closely associated with hormones, inflammation, dysfunctional immunity, oxidative stress, genetic and epigenetic factors as well as environmental factors, the pathogenesis of endometriosis has not been completely elucidated [4].', 'Ferroptosis, a new type of regulated cell death, is triggered by the iron-catalysed process of lipid peroxidation initiated via nonenzymatic (Fenton reactions) and enzymatic mechanisms (lipoxygenases) [5]. It is characterised by small dysmorphic mitochondria with decreased cristae and condensed and ruptured outer membranes and is closely related to iron, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism, and glutathione, phospholipid, coenzyme Q10, and NADPH biosynthesis [6, 7]. Ferroptosis is modulated by intracellular iron overload. However, in endometriosis, endometrial cells are not destroyed but instead survive, implant, and grow in the ectopic lesions that contain high levels of iron as a result of repeated bleeding episodes and the gradual accumulation of menstrual debris and antiquated blood in the cyst fluid [8]. Thus, it was hypothesised that endometrial cells can resist iron-mediated ferroptosis [9]. In addition, a recent study reported that ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) were more sensitive to erastin-induced ferroptosis [10]. Therefore, ferroptosis has drawn immense attention as a promising target for new therapeutic strategies.', 'Recently, a wide range of angiogenic, inflammatory, and growth-stimulating cytokines have been detected in the serum, peritoneal fluid, and endometrium of patients with endometriosis, suggesting the potential role of inflammation in the progression of this disorder [11]. It has been reported that elevated expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 8 (IL8) induce the production of vascular endothelial cells in ectopic endometrial lesions and that anti-VEGF/VEGF receptor treatments suppress the development of endometriosis in animal models [12, 13]. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) enhances endometriotic cell proliferation, decreases apoptosis, and induces the secretion of IL6 and IL8 in endometriotic tissues, leading to increased proliferation in endometriosis [14, 15]. Ferroptosis induction has been reported to be associated with increased IL6 and IL8 expression [16]. To reduce iron overload, injection of deferoxamine, an iron chelator, into a murine endometriosis model decreased inflammation and limited lesion proliferation [17]. Further work demonstrated that treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), reduced the volume and weight of endometriotic lesions induced in rodents compared to the controls [18]. In addition, an observational cohort study showed the effectiveness of NAC for endometriosis treatment without side effects [19]. These studies reveal a contrasting ferroptosis mechanism underlying endometriosis, suggesting that ferroptosis may be a double-edged sword in endometriosis. Although it is a promising treatment target, it may also be closely correlated with inflammation and the progression of endometriotic lesions.', 'The role of ferroptosis in endometriosis has not yet been systematically examined. In this study, we observed ferroptosis in ectopic lesions. We found that ferroptosis of ESCs induced VEGFA and IL8 secretion, and explored its potential effects on angiogenesis of adjacent lesions during the development of endometriosis. Our results provide new insights into ferroptosis in endometriosis, which can be translated into clinical practice.', 'Endometriotic cysts exhibit localised iron overload and persistent oxidative stress [20], which may trigger ferroptosis. However, it is not clear whether ferroptosis occurs in endometriotic lesions. As ferroptosis is specifically characterised by mitochondria that appear smaller than normal with increased membrane density, this feature can be used to distinguish ferroptosis from apoptotic or necrotic death, or autophagy [7]. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we could observe shrunken mitochondria with increased membrane density and reduced mitochondrial cristae on the inner surface of the cyst walls (Fig 1Aa). However, the same mitochondrial changes were not observed on the outer cyst walls (Fig 1Ab). In addition, lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation-which plays a central role in the ferroptosis pathway in eukaryotic organisms [21], was measured among eutopic endometrium and lesion cyst cells by flow cytometry using the fluorescent probe C11-BODIPY. The results demonstrated that the endometriotic cyst showed increased lipid peroxidation compared to eutopic endometrium (39.80 +/- 1.95% vs. 52.64 +/- 2.04%, P < 0.01) (Fig 1B). Moreover, we investigated the expression of important ferroptosis-related genes, such as SAT1, PEBP1 and DPP4-which drive ferroptosis, and GPX4 and DJ-1-which suppresses it, upon their activation [22-24]. We found that the level of DPP4 was higher in ectopic lesions, whereas that of DJ-1 was lower in lesions than in eutopic endometrium (Fig 1C). It has been reported that DPP4 controls lipid metabolism, while DJ-1 is associated with glutathione metabolism during ferroptosis [22, 24]. However, no significant differences in GPX4, SAT1 and PEBP1 expression levels were detected between the two groups.', 'Furthermore, to simulate the microenvironment of ectopic endometrial cells, we co-cultured primary ESCs with diluted cyst fluid (1:1) for 12 h. Surprisingly, we detected an obvious elevation of lipid ROS levels (22.33 +/- 4.02% vs. 66.03 +/- 2.77%, P < 0.001) (Fig 1D) and observed smaller mitochondria with increased membrane density (Fig 1E), implying that the contents of endometrioma might trigger ferroptosis in the ectopic endometrium. Altogether, these results suggested that ferroptosis does occur in endometriotic cysts.', 'To explore why endometrial cells of ectopic lesions survive and grow in spite of stromal cell ferroptosis and also if ESC ferroptosis benefits the progression of ectopic lesions, we investigated erastin-induced ESC ferroptosis. First, to explore the susceptibility of ESCs to erastin-induced ferroptosis, we treated primary ESCs with erastin at different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 uM) under a time gradient (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h). Obvious ESC morphological changes were observed after treatment with 30 uM erastin for 12 h (Supplementary Fig 1). We additionally found markedly elevated lipid ROS accumulations (16.47 +/- 3.21% vs. 57.20 +/- 3.38%, P < 0.001) and notable mitochondrial changes in this culture condition (Fig 2A, B), indicating that erastin caused ferroptotic cell death in ESCs. To confirm the concrete effect of ferroptosis, ESCs were treated with either DMSO or 30 uM erastin, and total RNA derived from these cells was subjected to RNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that following erastin treatment, 352 transcripts were significantly upregulated or downregulated (>=2-fold, P < 0.05) in ESCs, and multiple secretory factors known to be associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, and growth were observed in the list of upregulated entities including VEGFA, IL8, angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTK4), adrenomedullin (ADM), IL1A, IL2, IL11, cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), and amphiregulin (AREG) (Fig 2C, G), consistent with previous studies showing that ferroptosis accelerates inflammation [25]. We performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition to enrichment in neuronal death, stress response, and apoptotic processes, DEGs were also enriched in vasculature development and cell differentiation (Fig 2D and E). In addition, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that these DEGs were mainly involved in MAPK signalling (Fig 2F). We verified the upregulation by examining the levels of a few secretory factors, which also showed significantly higher expression after treatment with erastin (Fig 2G). Thus, we can conclude that erastin-induced ESC ferroptosis in turn induced the secretion of angiogenic, inflammatory, and growth factors, which may be associated with angiogenesis and the progression of ectopic lesions.', 'VEGFA and IL8 are pivotal angiogenic factors [26, 27] playing an essential role in the pathological progression of endometriosis [12]. To confirm that ESC ferroptosis induced angiogenic cytokine expression (VEGFA and IL8), the primary ESCs were first treated with erastin at different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 50 and 100 uM) and for different time periods (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h). Compared to the control, the expression of VEGFA and IL8 increased significantly upon erastin treatment from 30 to 50 uM and in a time-dependent manner from 0 to 12 h (Fig 2H, I). Various ferroptosis inducers, such as (1S,3R)-RSL3, TBHP, and the endometriotic cyst fluid were used to treat ESCs. (1S,3R)-RSL3 is another potential ferroptosis agonist that directly inhibits GPX4, and TBHP was used to simulate oxidative stress conditions, which ultimately resulted in considerable lipid peroxidation [6, 28]. As shown in Fig 3A, B, the mRNA and protein levels of VEGFA and IL8 were significantly upregulated under the three conditions. In addition, as a precursor of intracellular antioxidant glutathione [29], NAC rescued cell death morphologically (Supplemental Fig 2A) and inhibited VEGFA and IL8 induction by erastin at the mRNA, intracellular, and secretory protein levels (Fig 3C-E). These findings suggest that ESC ferroptosis induces VEGFA and IL8 production. Investigations in several cell lines including 293T, ISK, and KGN also revealed that VEGFA and IL8 levels were only upregulated in primary ESCs (Fig 3F), implying a unique mechanism of ESC ferroptosis. We next examined the effect of stromal VEGFA and IL8 on HUVEC vascular formation using conditioned media derived from erastin-treated ESCs. The Matrigel tube formation assay showed that HUVEC tube-like structure formation (measured based on the total number of branches) was considerably enhanced in cells cultured with the medium from erastin-induced ESCs (erastin-treated ESCs group vs DMSO-treated ESCs group, 39 +/- 2.51 vs. 24 +/- 1.76, P < 0.01; erastin-treated ESC group vs. erastin with basic medium group, 39 +/- 2.51 vs. 22.8 +/- 1.59, P < 0.001) (Fig 3G, H). However, the angiogenesis-promoting effects of ferroptosis were obviously abrogated in the presence of NAC (NAC- and erastin-treated ESCs group vs. erastin-treated ESCs group, 19.8 +/- 3.06 vs. 39 +/- 2.51, P < 0.0001) (Fig 3G, H). These data indicate that ESC ferroptosis might promote angiogenesis of surrounding tissues through the release of VEGFA and IL8, thus contributing to primary lesion survival.', 'We further investigated the mechanism of ferroptosis-induced VEGFA and IL8 upregulation in ESCs. As KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the DEGs of erastin-treated ESCs were mainly involved in the MAPK signalling pathway (Fig 2F), we first examined the activation of the p38 MAPK signalling pathway using western blot. Upon treatment of ESCs with erastin, the phosphorylation levels of P38 were elevated but attenuated by the addition of NAC (Fig 4A). We then treated the cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, and noted that the p38 inhibition significantly decreased erastin-induced VEGFA and IL8 expression (Fig 4B, C). Furthermore, analysis of the sequences within 5 kb from the transcription start sites (TSSs) of VEGFA and IL8 using RcisTarget [30] identified enriched motifs for DNA-binding activators (cisbp _ M3992 motif-binding STAT6) both in the TSSs of VEGFA and IL8 (Fig 4D). To address this, we selected the region 2000 bp upstream of VEGFA and IL8 TSSs or mutated the M3992 motif, fused these sequences to a reporter gene expressing firefly luciferase, and then co-transfected 293T cells with them and the STAT6 expression plasmid. The results showed that STAT6 specifically activated the firefly luciferase of the wild-type promoter, but had no effect on the reporter plasmid (Fig 4D). Then, we detected STAT6 activation upon erastin and NAC treatment (Fig 4A), and using siRNA we knocked down STAT6 in erastin-treated ESCs. This partially suppressed VEGFA and IL8 expression, suggesting that STAT6 contributes, at least in part, to ferroptosis-mediated VEGFA and IL8 production (Fig 4E, F). Collectively, the above results indicate that the p38 MAPK/STAT6 signalling pathway contributes to ferroptosis-mediated VEGFA and IL8 expression.', 'We further investigated the location and expression of VEGFA and IL8 in endometriosis biospecimens. Surprisingly, we found that VEGFA and IL8 were both highly expressed on the inner surface of ovarian cysts using IF, while no localised specific expression was observed in the control and eutopic endometria (Fig 5A). Moreover, the expression of VEGFA and IL8 in lesions was significantly higher than that in the eutopic and control samples, as detected using RT-qPCR and IHC (Fig 5B, C), indicating that VEGFA and IL8 expression might be closely related to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.', 'The term """"ferroptosis"""", defined as a distinct form of regulated cell death characterised by iron-catalysed lethal lipid peroxidation, was first coined by Dixon et al. [7]. Iron accumulation serves as an initial element in ferroptotic cell death [31]. Ovarian endometrioma is an ovarian cyst lined with endometrial tissue histologically and functionally resembling eutopic endometrium, which is generally considered to be filled with menstrual debris and antiquated blood [8]. Inside the cyst, the concentrations of free iron, ROS, and lipid peroxide are ten to hundreds of times higher than those in peripheral blood or other types of benign cysts, providing an iron overload and oxidative microenvironment for lesion growth [20, 32]. There is a point of view that the implanted ectopic endometrium can resist ferroptosis and survive in a microenvironment with iron overload due to dysregulated iron homoeostasis [33]. The latest meta-analysis of online datasets demonstrated that the ferroptosis pathway presents a downregulation trend among the ectopic, eutopic, and control endometria [34]. In contrast, according to previous studies, ectopic endometriotic lesions had significantly higher levels of ROS, hydrogen peroxide, and oxidative stress activity [35, 36]. Whether ferroptosis exists and has potential effects on the development of ectopic lesions has not yet been proven. Given that there is no gold standard to detect ferroptosis, we observed the ultrastructure of endometriotic cysts using TEM and found for the first time obvious mitochondrial morphological changes on its inner surface, consistent with the morphological features of ferroptosis. Moreover, we treated primary ESCs with cyst fluid in vitro and found a markedly elevated level of lipid ROS and shrunk mitochondria with increased membrane density, indicating that ESC ferroptosis was induced by the chocolate cyst fluid.', 'Surprisingly, we found that erastin-induced ESC ferroptosis could trigger the production of angiogenic, inflammatory, and growth cytokines, which may provide an original thinking to the positive effect of ferroptosis on the development of endometriosis. The small molecule erastin has been applied in many diseases as a ferroptosis trigger to explore the mechanism of this newly discovered non-apoptotic cell death in vitro [7, 31, 37]. Although a recent study showed that ectopic ESCs were more sensitive to erastin-induced ferroptosis than normal ESCs, suggesting that erastin may be a novel therapy for endometriosis [10], we show here that higher concentrations of erastin could trigger both eutopic and ectopic ESC ferroptosis and also subsequently induce the secretion of cytokines, such as VEGFA and IL8 (Supplemental Fig 2A-C). VEGFA is generally regarded as a vital angiogenic factor, which attaches to the vascular endothelium to initiate cell proliferation and endothelial angiogenesis and increases vascular permeability [11]. Furthermore, IL8 signalling increases cell proliferation and survival to promote angiogenic responses in endothelial cells [38]. According to a study by Sun et al., IL6 and IL8 secretion was elevated in erastin-treated retinal pigment epithelial cells as senescence-associated factors [16]. Nevertheless, few other studies have investigated the potential role of ferroptosis in vascular formation. Our study is the first to demonstrate that ESCs in the process of ferroptosis, stimulate VEGFA and IL8 secretion, which may contribute to endometriotic lesion angiogenesis. Hence, ferroptosis might act as a double-edged sword in the progression of endometriosis. On the one hand, the agonist erastin might be a promising agent for triggering ferroptosis in lesions. On the other hand, some stromal cells undergoing ferroptosis secrete a series of cytokines to promote vascular system formation of surrounding tissues via paracrine actions, which may enhance benign cell proliferation and accelerate the progression of this disorder. Thus, we aimed to identify an inhibitor to attenuate cytokine secretion. Unfortunately, we have not investigated other cytokines, such as growth factors (ADM and AREG) and inflammatory factors (IL2), induced by ferroptosis. Further studies are also needed to explore more potential effects of ferroptosis on endometriosis.', ""According to our study, NAC could serve as an efficacious agent for suppressing ferroptosis-induced cytokine secretion. NAC, the acetylated precursor of l-cysteine, is generally considered as an anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidative agent. However, recent studies showed that NAC could also reverse lipid ROS levels and act as an inhibitor against ferroptosis [39, 40]. Its curative effect has been studied in a variety of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, nephropathy, and heavy-metal toxicity [29, 41]. In endometriosis, animal experiments have already demonstrated its antioxidative functions in reducing the weight and size of ectopic lesions [19]. Moreover, in an observational cohort study, NAC was proposed as a promising treatment for endometriosis by decreasing the size and number of cysts, reducing dysmenorrhoea symptoms, and increasing chances of conception without side effects, but its mechanism has not been elucidated [42]. In this study, we incubated NAC with erastin-treated ESCs and surprisingly found that NAC rescued cell death morphologically and suppressed the secretion of VEGFA and IL8. Thus, it counteracted the stimulatory effect of ferroptosis on angiogenesis, providing a novel insight into mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of NAC in endometriosis."", 'Our study showed that the p38 MAPK/STAT6 signalling is one of the main downstream regulators of erastin-induced ferroptosis and that it mediates the secretion of VEGFA and IL8 in ESCs. A recent report revealed that ferroptosis inducers, such as RSL3 and erastin, induced the ASK1-p38 MAPK pathway activation downstream of lipid ROS in A549 cells [43]. JNK and p38, except for the ERK MAPK pathway, were also responsible for erastin-induced ferroptosis in an acute myeloid leukaemia cell line [44]. Furthermore, VEGFA expression was found to be regulated by activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, playing an important role in angiogenesis [45, 46]. We found increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in erastin-treated ESCs. The addition of a p38 inhibitor significantly repressed VEGFA and IL8 production. Other studies have shown that the coordinated modulation of STAT6 and p38 MAPK exhibited potential effects on the induction of IL4 and IL13 and that p38 MAPK could directly regulate the activity of the transactivation domain of STAT6 [47-49]. In erastin-induced ESCs, we also detected STAT6 activation, and transfection of STAT6 siRNA attenuated the expression of VEGFA and IL8. Moreover, the luciferase reporter assay revealed a direct connection between STAT6 and both VEGFA and IL8. These data imply a critical link between the p38 MAPK/STAT6 pathway and ferroptosis-mediated VEGFA and IL8 expression in ESCs.', 'We also observed localised specific expression of VEGFA and IL8 in ectopic cysts and detected higher expression levels of VEGFA and IL8 in ectopic lesions, than in eutopic and control endometria in patients with endometriosis. Restricted by sample size, we failed to explore alterations in the expression levels and functions of VEGFA and IL8 during menstrual cycles. According to previous studies, the endometrial stromal cells present no differences in VEGF and IL8 expression throughout the menstrual phase [50, 51].', 'In conclusion, we detected ferroptosis caused by an iron overload on the inner surface of endometriotic cysts. Erastin-induced primary ESC ferroptosis stimulated VEGFA and IL8 secretion through the p38 MAPK/STAT6 pathway and promoted angiogenesis in vitro. Thus, ferroptosis may play a critical role in the progression of endometriosis by resulting in angiogenic effects via paracrine VEGFA and IL8 action on the adjacent lesions. NAC, which serves as a potential anti-ferroptosis agent, is expected to contribute significantly to the treatment of endometriosis.', 'Thirty-six women of reproductive age who underwent laparoscopic and hysteroscopic procedures at the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital (IPMCH), Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, were recruited into this study. All enrolled women had regular menstrual cycles and did not receive hormonal therapy or use intrauterine contraception for at least 6 months prior to surgery. Patients with metabolic diseases, hypertension, inflammatory disease, autoimmune disorders, and cancer were excluded from the study. Twelve women with teratoma diagnosis who underwent combined hysteroscopy and laparoscopy according to their surgery options without macroscopic lesions in the uterine cavity served as the control group. Normal endometrial samples were obtained using an endometrial curette. Eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues were collected from 24 patients with ovarian endometrioma using curette and laparoscopy, respectively. The demographic and baseline characteristics of patients in terms of age, body mass index, and parity had no significant difference between the control and endometriosis groups (Supplemental Table 1).', 'We dissected the samples using surgical scissors and tweezers and divided them into three groups. Group 1 samples were transported to the laboratory in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco, New York, USA) on ice for cell isolation. Group 2 samples were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis. Group 3 samples were maintained in cryotubes and stored in liquid nitrogen for further RNA and protein extraction. The cyst fluid was aspirated by a 50 ml syringe and was then put in sterile 15 ml centrifugal tubes and stored at -80 ^0C until use.', 'The study protocol was approved by the ethics review committee of IPMCH and was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.', 'Primary ESCs were isolated from the eutopic or ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. The tissues were cut into pieces and digested with type I collagenase (1 mg/ml, Gibco, New York, USA) for 0.5-1 h at 37 ^0C. After removing debris and epithelial cells using 100 and 40 m cell strainers, respectively, ESCs were resuspended in DMEM/F12 containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, New York, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, New York, USA) and cultured in 5% CO_2 at 37 ^0C. The culture medium was replaced after the stromal cells had attached, to remove blood cells and debris. After reaching 80-90% confluency in 2-3 days, cells were seeded into 12-well plates for in vitro experiments.', 'ESC purity was detected using immunofluorescence for vimentin and cytokeratin 7 as markers of stromal and epithelial cells, respectively. The number of vimentin-positive cells was greater than 95% (Supplemental Fig 3).', 'The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, human endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa (ISK), human ovarian granulosa cell tumour cells (KGN), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were preserved in the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Embryo Original Diseases. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM High (Gibco, New York, USA) containing 10% FBS. ISK and KGN cells were grown in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, New York, USA) containing 10% FBS. HUVECs were incubated in an endothelial cell growth medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) containing an endothelial cell growth supplement. All media were supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin and cells were cultured in 5% CO_2 at 37 ^0C. The medium was replaced every 2 days until 90% confluency was reached. All experiments were performed using cell lines from the fifth to tenth passage.', 'ESCs were treated with different erastin concentrations (10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 uM) for 12 h, and for different time periods (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h) with 30 uM erastin. Cell morphology was observed using an inverted microscope (Leica, Germany). To identify the specific effects of ferroptosis on ESCs, primary ESCs were treated with several ferroptosis inducers, such as erastin (30 uM), (1S,3R)-RSL3 (10 uM), tert-butyl hydroperoxide solution (TBHP, 20 uM), diluted cyst fluid (1:1 dilution with complete medium), and with inhibitor NAC (10 uM) for 12 h. Furthermore, HEK293T, ISK and KGN were treated with 30 uM erastin for 12 h. To explore the role of p38 MAPK in ferroptosis-induced VEGFA and IL8 induction, ESCs were treated with erastin in the absence or presence of the p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (10 uM) for 12 h. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).', 'Ectopic cyst walls were cut into 1 cm^3 piece and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 ^0C overnight immediately after they were obtained from the operating table. Primary ESCs were treated with or without the cyst fluid (1:1 diluted with complete medium) or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or 30 M erastin for 12 h and then were washed thrice with PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 ^0C overnight. After washing in PBS twice for 10 min, the ectopic cyst wall pieces were fixed with 1% osmic acid at 4 ^0C for 2 h. Subsequently, the samples were dehydrated with an ethanol gradient and 100% acetone solution for 15 min and then embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin (70 nm) sections, obtained using an ultramicrotome, were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate for evaluation. Cell and mitochondrial morphology was captured using a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-7650, Japan).', 'DMSO- or erastin (30 uM)- or cyst fluid-treated cells or cells from the ESC isolation procedures were incubated with C11-BODIPY (581/591) (Invitrogen, California, USA) for 30 min at 37 ^0C. Cells were subsequently resuspended in 1 ml of fresh PBS and strained through a 40 m cell strainer for flow cytometry analysis. Lipid ROS levels were measured using an FFACScan (BD, New York, USA) through the FL1 channel (527 nm). Approximately 10,000 cells were analysed per sample. Data analysis was performed using the FlowJo version 10.0.', 'Primary ectopic ESCs were seeded in 6 cm plates and treated with 30 uM erastin for 12 h. The cells from each group were collected using the RNAiso Plus reagent (Takara Bio, Tokyo, Japan) and sent to Annoroad Gene Technology (Beijing, China) for RNA-seq. The raw data were submitted to the GEO database (PRJNA783151). The raw RNA-seq data (FASTQ files) were filtered using the Perl script. Bowtie2 was used to build the genome index, and the RNA-seq data were then aligned to the reference genome using HISAT2. Read counts for each gene were counted using HTSeq, and fragments per kilobase million mapped reads were then calculated to estimate the gene expression level in each sample. DEGs were identified using the DESeq2 [52] package in R. The DEG threshold was set at q <= 0.05, and |log2_ratio | >=1. DEG GO (http://geneontology.org/) and KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/) enrichment were performed using the hypergeometric test, where the p-value was calculated and adjusted as a q-value. GO and KEGG terms with q < 0.05 were considered to be significantly enriched.', ""The 2000 bp promoter sequence of VEGFA and IL8 was searched on the UCSC website (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway). Based on the obtained promoter sequence, we predicted the possible signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) transcription factor-binding region of the VEGFA and IL8 promoter sequences. Surprisingly, we found a common predicted STAT6 transcription factor-binding region in the VEGFA and IL8 2000 bp promoters (in the VEGFA mRNA 5'-UTR [GGGAAG, 1447-1452 nt] and IL8 mRNA 5'-UTR [AGGAAG, 1852-1857 nt)] regions). Then, we synthesised a target wild type (WT) sequence (GGGAAG/AGGAAG) and a mutant sequence (Mut) (GGGAAG/AGGAAG mutation) using site-directed mutagenesis.

Prompt diagnosis of DE is challenging, and developing new approaches for DE prediction before surgical intervention is of key importance for controlling the disease. Herein, we performed a case-control study to evaluate the role of plasma hemostatic parameters and inflammatory indices in predicting DE. Our results revealed that the combination of fibrinogen and hemoglobin had a good predictive value for DE before surgical intervention.', 'Endometriosis, which is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma at ectopic sites, affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. Up to 80% of women with endometriosis suffer from chronic pain, and up to 50% of women suffer from infertility. Endometriosis-related productivity loss and decreased quality of life lead to a heavy economic burden[1]. Endometriosis can be classified as superficial endometriosis (SUP), ovarian endometrioma (OMA), and deep endometriosis (DE)[2]. DE is the most aggressive of the three subtypes that constitute endometriosis. It is defined as an endometriotic lesion penetrating a depth of > 5 mm and showing aggressive behavior[3]. It can affect the uterosacral ligaments, parametrium, bladder, and bowel. Patients with DE usually present with severe pelvic pain and low fertility. The heterogeneity of the disease makes the diagnosis of DE a clinical challenge[4-6] that may be delayed for more than 8 years[7]. Accidental intraoperative diagnosis of DE is also common. DE often requires surgical therapy, and a high incidence of surgical morbidity of DE has been reported[8]. Therefore, developing new approaches for predicting DE before surgery is of crucial importance.', 'In previous years, symptoms and clinical history, pelvic examination, blood tests, transvaginal ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been proposed for the preoperative prediction of endometriosis[9-13]. However, the clinical presentation of DE tends to vary. Some women experience severe pain, while others remain asymptomatic[10-11]. Pelvic examination results and the accuracy of ultrasound or MRI diagnosis can significantly vary in relation to the location of DE[13], and assessment by vaginal examination or image diagnosis depends on the level of expertise. The benefit of blood test prediction of deep endometriosis would have the advantages of being noninvasive, no exposure to harmful radiation, rapid reporting, and low cost. Several studies have explored the predictive value of blood biomarkers such as serum CA-125 in DE[11-12]. Low sensitivity and specificity reduce the value of serum CA-125 as a single test in the diagnosis of DE. In fact, a reliable noninvasive marker for preoperative diagnosis of this disease has not yet been introduced.', 'The most widely accepted etiologic mechanism of endometriosis is retrograde menstruation resulting in ectopic implantation of endometrium in the pelvic cavity. The ectopic implanted endometrium can lead to recurrent bleeding, subsequent repeated tissue injury, and inflammation[14]. Endometriosis has also been associated with increased activation of the coagulation system and fibrinolysis system, and elevated plasma fibrinogen (Fg) levels, shortened thrombin time (TT), shortened activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), shortened prothrombin time (PT), and increased expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitors[15-19]. The data indicate that women with endometriosis might have a potential hypercoagulable state. Additionally, a high concentration of proinflammatory cytokines was reported in women with endometriosis[20-21]. Nevertheless, whether these routine hemostatic parameters and inflammatory indices have any predictive value in terms of preoperative diagnosis of DE has not yet been determined. This study was conducted to assess whether DE could be identified by routine hematological parameters before surgery. The study objectives were to estimate the predictive values of routine hemostatic parameters and inflammatory indices for DE.', ""A case-control study was performed at the Women's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine between January 2015 and December 2016. Approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee at Women's Hospital School of Medicine, Zhejiang University (IRB-20200049-R). Data were retrospectively retrieved from an electronic database. Inclusion criteria for the DE group were: (1) 18 to 40 years of age[13]; and (2) DE defined as endometriotic lesions that infiltrated the uterosacral ligaments by > 5 mm and muscularis propria (bladder, intestine, ureters). Lesions were confirmed by pathology. Patients with DE who simultaneously had SUP or OMA were also included[2,14]. Exclusion criteria for the DE group were: (1) A history of abnormal uterine bleeding in the previous 3 mo; (2) A history of acute inflammation, suspected infectious disease, malignancy, metabolic diseases, and autoimmune disease in the previous 3 mo; (3) Pregnancy; (4) Hormonal therapy, including oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, or any other hormonal treatment, antithrombotic and hemostatic agents, and herbal compounds during the previous 3 mo; (5) Medical emergencies; and (6) With non-fasting lipid profiles."", 'Women between 18 and 40 years of age with surgical treatment at the same time for benign gynecologic diseases, including benign ovarian tumors, tubal infertility, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and intrauterine adhesion, but without any evidence of endometriosis, were recruited as controls. Detailed histories, thorough physical examinations of the abdominal-pelvic cavity, and sonography screening were performed by designated experts. The exclusion criteria were the same as for the DE group. Women to be enrolled in the controls with suspected endometriosis presenting dysmenorrhea or tenderness in the pelvic cavity or were also excluded.', 'During the study period, 698 patients with endometriosis were scheduled for surgery in the general gynecology department. However, 667 women were excluded because they did not meet the selection criteria, 154 who were > 40 years of age, 251 with non-fasted blood collection, 138 with no surgical treatment, with hormonal treatment, or complicated by other diseases, 124 with pathologically proven endometriosis but not DE phenotype. The remaining 170 eligible women without endometriosis were enrolled; 75 cases were excluded, 30 because of suspected endometriosis, 21 with no surgical treatment, and 24 complicated by inflammatory, or metabolic, or autoimmune diseases.', 'All participants had routine peripheral blood tests before surgery. Blood samples with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the anticoagulant were used to obtain a complete blood count, platelet count, HB level, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count with a, autoanalyzer (Beckman, Coulter LH750). Coagulative parameters, including PT, TT, APTT, and Fg were determined with an automatic blood coagulation analyzer (STAGO, Evolution ISTA-R-IV, Germany). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), international normalized ratio (INR), platelet distribution width, neutrophil number, lymphocyte number, and mean platelet volume were also calculated. Considering crosstalk between lipid metabolism and coagulation function, serum lipid profiles including total cholesterol, total triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein were tested and measured by enzymatic colorimetric assay after an overnight fast of 12 h. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were simultaneously determined. The blood samples without EDTA were centrifuged at 3500 g, and serum supernatants were collected. CRP levels were assayed in fresh serum using an immunoturbidimetric assay (Abbott, Architect C16000). Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation for all measurements were 5% and 10%, respectively.', ""Continuous data were reported as means +/- SD for normally distributed variables, and variables that were not normally distributed were reported as medians and range. Between-group differences of variables with a normal distribution were tested by analysis of variance and Student's t-test. For variables with a non-normal distribution, differences were compared with Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests. Categorical variables were reported as n (%), and the ^2-square test was used to compare the distribution across different groups. Stepwise logistic regression was used to assess the association of hemostatic profiles with the presence of DE. All indices of interest such as age, body mass index (BMI), history of delivery and abortion, inflammatory indices, and serum lipid profiles that could cause a confounding bias were entered into the initial model as potential risk factors with SLE = 0.05 and SLS = 0.10. The final model was built using all significant variables in the multivariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the area under curves was calculated to determine the predictive power of the independent risk factors.

P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant."", 'A total of 126 women were enrolled in this study, 31 with DE and 95 without DE (Figure 1). The indications for surgery in the DE patients were a pelvic mass, history of infertility, pelvic pain with failed analgesics. DE involved the uterosacral ligament in 26 (83.9%) patients, the colorectal septum in two (6.5%), the ureter in one (3.2%), and the sigmoid in two (6.5%). Adenomyosis was suspected in 13 women with no uterine fibroids on transvaginal ultrasound. The indications for surgery in controls were benign ovarian tumors and tubal infertility (54 cases), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (28 cases), and intrauterine adhesion (13 cases). Baseline clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were no differences in age, BMI, parity, abortion, and lipid profiles between the study and the control groups.', 'Plasma Fg (P < 0.01), INR (P < 0.05), and CRP levels (P < 0.01) of women with DE were significantly higher than those in controls. Plasma HB levels (P < 0.05) and TT (P < 0.05) of women with DE were significantly lower than those in controls. Differences between the other hematological parameters in the two groups were not significant (Table 2).', 'Multivariate analysis (Table 3) showed that plasma Fg levels [odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95%CI: 1.13-2.46], PT (OR 1.63, 95%CI: 1.12-2.38), plasma HB levels (OR 0.63, 95%CI: 0.42-0.92), and TT (OR 0.69, 95%CI: 0.48-0.99) were significantly associated with the presence of DE (all P < 0.05). No relationships between the other hematological parameters and the presence of DE were found. APTT, INR, NLR, and PLR were not included in the multivariable logistic models, considering that they overlapped with other parameters.', 'After adjusting for potentially confounding factors including age, BMI, history of delivery and abortion, and serum lipid profiles, plasma Fg levels [adjusted OR (aOR) 2.12, 95%CI: 1.31-3.75] and plasma HB levels (aOR 0.48, 95%CI: 0.29-0.78) remained significantly associated with the presence of DE (both P < 0.05, Table 4). The relationship between PT/TT and DE was no longer significant.', 'The predictive performance of Fg and HB for DE was investigated using ROC analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of Fg was 0.639 (95%CI: 0.524-0.755, sensitivity = 58.1%, specificity = 70.5%), and that of HB was 0.664 (95%CI: 0.552-0.776, sensitivity = 64.5%, specificity = 62.1%) for the diagnosis of DE. The AUC of the combination of both markers was 0.773 with improved sensitivity (67.7%) and specificity (78.9%) at a cutoff of 3.09 (g/L) and 126 (g/L), respectively (Table 4, Figure 2). The combination of both markers as a dual marker index significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy.', 'This study examined the predictive values of hemostatic parameters and inflammatory indices for DE. Our data suggest that the combination of Fg and HB levels could be used as a reliable predictor of DE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that evaluated hemostatic parameters and inflammatory indices for the prediction of DE. Fg is a known coagulation factor associated with hypercoagulation. As an acute-phase reaction and a hemostatic parameter, Fg has an important role in coagulation, inflammation, and the maintenance of hemostasis[22-23]. Fg is also a marker of inflammation and a major determinant of thrombosis and hemorheology[24]. In this study, we found elevated Fg levels in DE patients, which is consistent with previous findings[15-16].', 'Increasing evidence shows that pathophysiological changes in endometriosis have features in common with those observed during tissue injury and repair (TIAR)[3,25-26]. TIAR process may contribute to the development of endometriosis. The coagulation and fibrinolytic systems have important roles in TIAR[27]. An increase in plasma Fg is more likely caused by recurrent bleeding in the ectopic implantation of the endometrium and the impairment of the fibrinolytic system in endometriosis. Elevated Fg levels may reflect hemorheological disorders, a potential hypercoagulable status, and subclinical systemic inflammation in endometriosis.', 'In this study, a shortened TT was found in women with DE, which is in line with previous studies[16-17]. TT reflects anticoagulation, and a shortened TT indicates hypo-fibrinolysis. In this study, an inverse relationship between TT and DE was initially detected by multivariate analysis. After adjusting for confounding factors, the association was no longer significant. Moreover, no differences in APTT and TT were found between the DE and the control groups.', 'Decreased plasma HB levels were identified in women with DE in this study, which is in line with the findings in women with OMA[28-29]. Moreover, our results revealed an inverse relationship between plasma HB levels and the presence of DE. An inverse association between severity of endometriosis and plasma HB levels was reported in another study[30]. The exact cause of low plasma HB levels in patients with endometriosis is not clear. It may be associated with erythrocyte regulation of iron metabolism disorders or chronic systemic inflammation[31-32]. Low plasma HB levels may be associated with hypoxia, which has been reported to facilitating endometriosis development[33]. Further studies are required to investigate how HB contributes to the development of DE.', 'Serum CA-125 antigen is the most frequently used biomarker in the diagnosis of endometriosis in clinic practice[11,34-35]. Santulli et al[36] reported that serum CA-125 antigen was significantly associated with the severity and the penetration depth of DE; but it is not widely used in the diagnosis of DE. In this study, we found that either plasma Fg levels alone or plasma HB levels were not powerful enough to predict DE. A good predictive value for DE was obtained when plasma Fg levels were combined with HB levels. The AUC of the combination was 0.773, and the specificity was 78.9% at cutoffs of 3.09 g/L and 126 g/L. Ding et al[37] investigated the predictive role of Fg for endometriosis and found that the combination of Fg and serum CA-125 had good predictive power for OMA. They showed that Fg had potential predictive value for endometriosis, which is consistent with our results. Our model for predicting DE with the use of plasma Fg and HB may have clinical implications. Using this model, patients suspected of DE should undergo a thorough preoperative assessment through pelvic examination and pelvic imaging to detect DE nodules. Nonetheless, further studies for optimized predictive tools for DE are warranted.', 'Endometriosis is associated with an inflammatory response. In this study, increased CRP levels were found in the DE group, and there the difference in NLR between women with or without DE was not significant. The results of the value of inflammatory indices such as CRP and NLR in endometriosis in previous studies are not consistent[29,37-38]. This inconsistency may be associated with a different course, subtypes, and sample sizes used in those studies. In this study, multivariate analysis did not identify any association between CRP and NLR and the presence of DE.', 'Low HB levels could be caused by other bleeding disorders such as adenomyosis and uterine fibroids. In this study, 13 patients in the DE group had suspected adenomyosis with no uterine fibroids. Nonetheless, they did not complain of abnormal menstrual bleeding, and the HB levels were still within the normal range. Thus, the decreased HB levels of the DE group could not be attributed to concomitant adenomyosis. In addition, the coexistence of adenomyosis and endometriosis is well known[39]. We could not exclude the women with both DE and adenomyosis from the DE group in this study.', 'Our study has several limitations. First, the size of the DE group was relatively small. The low incidence of DE and strict criteria imposed in this study limited the enrollment. Additionally, this is the first study that evaluated the predictive role of hemostatic parameters for DE, and one of the aims of this study was to inspire future larger investigations. Second, as we did not include cases with only SUP or OMA subtypes, the results may not be applicable for all patients with endometriosis. Finally, there was no ideal control group for studying plasma Fg levels in DE. Our control group consisted of women with surgery for benign gynecological conditions, which permitted a thorough assessment of DE. However, some of the conditions, such as tubal infertility or ovarian cysts, might be associated with altered plasma levels.', 'In addition to the limitations, the following strengths should also be pointed out. First, the results of Fg/HB and the presence of DE were consistent in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Second, we for adjusted those confounding factors to eliminate possible effects on coagulation function and inflammatory response, which could make the predictive value of Fg and HB more reliable. In addition, these effects were not investigated in the previous relevant studies on endometriosis.', 'The study findings support the routine combination of Fg and HB as an essential part of the preoperative assessment of patients with suspected DE. The model can be adopted for use in clinical practice. Furthermore, this study suggests that an altered coagulation system may have key involvement in the development of endometriosis. The results also suggested that patients with DE may have a potential hypercoagulable state. Further studies are required to determine the anticoagulant therapy for these patients.', 'A combination of Fg and HB could be used in routine clinical practice as a reliable predictor of DE before surgical intervention. Future studies with larger samples are needed to verify the findings and to investigate how Fg and HB contribute to the development of endometriosis, particularly DE.', 'Deep endometriosis (DE) is the most aggressive subtype of the disease. The diagnosis of DE is challenging. No biomarkers have been identified for discriminating women with DE from those without DE.', 'Developing new approaches for predicting DE before surgery is of crucial importance. It is unclear whether DE could be identified by routine hematological evaluation before surgery.', 'To evaluate the role of blood hemostatic parameters and inflammatory indices in the prediction of DE before surgical intervention.', 'A case-control study investigated the value of routine plasma hemostatic parameters and inflammatory indices in women with DE and without endometriosis.

6018,35051828,2022,Journal of reproductive immunology,3.4,CD200S-positive granulated lymphoid cells in endometrium appear to be CD56-positive uterine NK cells.,"The eutopic secretory phase endometrium in endometriosis overproduces and releases a soluble immunosuppressive CD200 molecule (CD200L) and is populated by stromal cells that contain a truncated CD200 (CD200S) that promotes a proinflammatory environment. The CD200S+ cell population persists when pregnancy occurs and are abundant in the early pregnancy decidua of women with missed abortion. In the present study, CD200S+, CD56+, and CD68+ cells were enumerated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from women with endometriosis and non-endometriosis controls. CD200S+ cells were more numerous than CD68+ macrophages and were similar in number and location to CD56bright endometrial NK cells. In some endometria, there was an additional population of CD200S- CD56+ NK cells. In ectopic endometrial peritoneal deposits and in ectopic myometrial deposits (adenomyosis), CD200S+ cells were less frequent, consistent with the known paucity of CD56+ NK cells in sites of ectopic deposits. CD200S+ cell frequency was greater in stroma surrounding the smaller ectopic cystic deposits. Dual immunofluorescent antibody staining confirmed CD200S+ cells were CD56+ NK cells. CD200S+ NK cell frequency may be greater in endometriosis patients' endometrium and may affect embryo survival in early pregnancy. In our opinion, regulation of alternative splicing that results in CD200S rather than CD200L may provide new diagnostic and therapeutic options for women with endometriosis.",[]

It has various biological functions, such as inhibiting melanin synthesis and inducting cell death in cancerous cells. In addition, Cudrania tricuspidata is known to be effective in female diseases, and previous studies have shown anticancer effects in cervical cancer, a female reproductive disease. Outside of that, Cudrania tricuspidata has various physiological effects. However, the effect of 6,8-diprenylorobol is not well known in other benign and chronic diseases, even in endometriosis, which commonly arises in the female reproductive tract. In the present study, we determined the inhibitory effects of 6,8-diprenylorobol on the growth of endometriosis VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells. Results indicated that 6,8-diprenylorobol suppressed cellular proliferation and increased the disruption of the cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), generation of reactive oxygen species, and Ca2+ homeostasis in both endometriosis cells. However, the proliferation of normal stromal cells isolated from endometrial tissue was not altered by 6,8-diprenylorobol. The change in Ca2+ levels was estimated in fluo-4- or rhod-2-stained VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells after the treatment of the intracellular calcium regulators 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and ruthenium red (RUR) with 6,8-diprenylorobol. A combination of 6,8-diprenylorobol with each regulator decreased the calcium accumulation in endometriosis cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated that 6,8-diprenylorobol inactivated AKT pathways, whereas it activated P38 MAPK pathways. In addition, 6,8-diprenylorobol decreased mitochondrial respiration, leading to the reduction in ATP production in VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells. Collectively, our results suggested that 6,8-diprenylorobol might be a potential therapeutic agent or adjuvant therapy for the management of endometriosis.","[""Endometriosis (EMS) is a gynecological disease, defined as the abnormal presence of endometrial-like tissue, such as ovarian, pelvic, intestinal, or fallopian tubes, outside of a woman's womb. The age for prevalence of endometriosis is 25-35 years, and it increases the prevalence of ovarian cancer to more than 50% compared to a healthy woman [1]. Further, an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammation process is a hallmark of endometriosis, and the symptoms of EMS include pelvic pain, menstrual pain, pain with bowel movements, and infertility [2]. The cause of endometriosis is not clearly known, but the pathologic retrograde menstruation theory, which explains that backward menstrual blood flow cannot be removed in the abdominal cavity, is usually accepted. This theory is reported to be related to immunology [3]. The major therapeutic methodologies of endometriosis are surgery or hormone therapy; however, the surgery for endometriosis should be repeated, and hormone therapy drugs, including GnRH-a and progestin, have side effects such as bone loss, amenorrhea, weight gain, and depression [4]. Therefore, with unclear causes of the development of endometriosis, the patients' lives are negatively impacted simultaneously. Hence, as a consequence, the treatment method for endometriosis should be enhanced."", 'Phytochemicals belong to the second metabolite of plants and various chemicals such as polyphenols, flavonoids, coumarin, and steroid saponin. These phytochemicals have been previously used in conventional medicine therapies [5]. Flavonoids are one of the phytochemical classes, and have several health-enhancing effects, such as antioxidation, anti-cell proliferation, anticancer, and anti-inflammation [6]. Cudrania tricuspidata has been used as a folk remedy for a long time, and is regarded as good for insomnia, weakness, and female diseases [7]. In addition, various physiological effects of Cudrania tricuspidata have been determined through previous studies. Representatively, there was a study to inhibit cell proliferation by increasing the expression of p53 and inducing apoptosis through the extracellular pathway when the Cudrania tricuspidata stem extract was used to treat cervical cancer [8]. In addition, the study showed anticancer effects in breast and colorectal cancer [9,10]. Another study showed that it has neuroprotective and cytoprotective effects [11,12]. Through this, a study was conducted to find out the effect of 6,8-diprenylorobol, which is one of the Cudrania tricuspidata extracts showing various effects. 6,8-Diprenylorobol belongs to the class of flavonoids and can be extracted from the leaves of Cudrania tricuspidata [13]. 6,8-Diprenylorobol exhibits anti-cell proliferation, anticancer, antifungal and anti-Helicobacter pylori activities [14,15]. For example, 6,8-diprenylorobol indicated an anticancer effect that induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by inhibiting cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily J member 2 (CYP2J2) and activating forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) [16]. In addition, 6,8-diprenylorobol induced apoptosis in colon cancer by activating the P53 apoptotic cell signal pathway [17]. However, the antiproliferation effects of 6,8-diprenylorobol on human endometriosis have not yet been identified.', 'Thus, we examined the effects of 6,8-diprenylorobol on endometriosis for the following: (1) suppression of cellular proliferation; (2) induction of cell cycle arrest; (3) impairment of mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis; (4) dysregulation of the intracellular signaling pathway (PI3K/AKT signal); and (5) changes in PI3K/AKT protein expression by 6,8-diprenylorobol with inhibitor.', 'The 6,8-diprenylorobol (Cat.

Our results indicated that 2 M of 6,8-diprenylorobol reduced proliferation by more than 50% in both cell types. In addition, to confirm the toxicity of 6',8-diprenylorobol in normal endometrial cells, the cell proliferation was performed using primary human normal uterine stromal cells. Accordingly, only 8% of cell proliferation was decreased by 6,8-diprenylorobol, compared to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 1B). Furthermore, when VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells were treated with 6,8-diprenylorobol, the relative expression of green fluorescence (PCNA), representing a proliferation marker, was reduced by more than 50% compared to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 1C).

In response to 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment with varying concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 M), the relative cell population of the subG0/G1 phase in End1/E6E7 cells was gradually increased. In addition, the G2/M phase cell population in both cell types was gradually decreased by 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment (Figure 1D).

Our results revealed that 6,8-diprenylorobol induced the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane in both cell lines (Figure 2A,B). The 2 M of 6,8-diprenylorobol in both cells significantly raised the relative MMP loss ratio up to 581% (p < 0.001) in VK2/E6E7 and 673% (p < 0.001) in End1/E6E7. In addition, we examined the production of ROS in response to the 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment. The relative percentage of ROS production was increased by up to 207% (p < 0.05) in VK2/E6E7 and 252% (p < 0.01) in End1/E6E7 treated with 2 M of 6,8-diprenylorobol compared to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 2C,D). Based on these results, we demonstrated that 6,8-diprenylorobol induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibited the oxidative stress buffering system.', 'Calcium homeostasis disruption could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, to measure the interfering effect of 6,8-diprenylorobol on calcium homeostasis in human endometriosis-like cells, we conducted fluo-4 and rhod-2 dye staining of both cell lines. An increase in fluo-4 and rhod-2 dyes represented the calcium accumulation in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix, respectively. Intracellular cytosolic calcium levels were gradually upregulated by 6,8-diprenylorobol, up to 827% in VK2/E6E7 and 498% in End/E6E7 compared to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 3A). In addition, mitochondrial calcium levels of 6,8-diprenylorobol-treated cells were increased by 285% and 258% in VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells, respectively, compared to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 3B) Furthermore, we executed the changes in cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial matrix calcium with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) or ruthenium red (RUR), which are calcium inhibitors, to verify the mechanism of calcium influx by 6,8-diprenylorobol in the human endometriosis-like cell lines. Relative calcium accumulation in cytosol was mitigated from 352% to 165% in VK2/E6E7 cells, and from 678% to 325% in End1/E6E7 by cotreatment of 2-APB and 6,8-diprenylorobol, compared to cells solely treated with 6,8-diprenylorobol (Figure 4A,B). Similarly, the accumulation of calcium ions in the mitochondrial matrix was mitigated from 185% to 142% in VK2/E6E7, and from 171% to 130% in End1/E6E7 by cotreatment of ruthenium red and 6,8-diprenylorobol, compared to 6,8-diprenylorobol solo treatment. However, there was no significant difference in RUR cotreatment as compared to 6,8-diprenylorobol alone. It seemed that accumulation of calcium ions by 6,8-diprenylorobol was primarily in the cytosol.', 'Mitochondrial respiration of VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells was measured with a Seahorse XFe analyzer. The mitochondrial respiratory rates of each phase are illustrated in Figure 5. The basal respiratory rates of 6,8-diprenylorobol-treated cells, prior to oligomycin treatment, were lower than those of vehicle-treated cells. Similarly, after the FCCP induction, the maximal respiratory rates of 6,8-diprenylorobol-treated cells were lower than those of the vehicle-treated cells in both cell lines. Moreover, the ATP-linked respiration was decreased by 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment in both cell lines. Using these results, we clearly confirmed that 6,8-diprenylorobol influenced the mitochondrial dysfunction.', ""We measured the phosphorylation status of PI3K/AKT using signaling proteins and P38 proteins in 6,8-diprenylorobol, and treated VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells for 24 h (Figure 6A).

However, the phosphorylation of P38 protein was increased in accordance with the 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment. Further, the inhibitory effects of pharmacological inhibitor LY294002 in the presence of 2 M of 6,8-diprenylorobol were analyzed (Figure 6B). We confirmed that the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT proteins was effectively inhibited by cotreatment with 6,8-diprenylorobol and LY294002 in both cell lines, compared to cells solely treated with 6,8-diprenylorobol."", 'Until recently, 6,8-diprenylorobol, one of the flavonoids, had not been studied actively. Even these limited studies of the bioactive effects of 6,8-diprenylorobol have mainly been conducted for cancers. In a previous study, 6,8-diprenylorobol exhibited antiproliferative and apoptotic effects, and increased the production of ROS in colon cancer [17]. In addition, 6,8-diprenylorobol suppressed cell viability and induced apoptosis in human liver cancer cells (HCC) via regulation of FOXO3 and CYP2J2 [16]. In addition, a previous study suggested that 6,8-diprenylorobol acted as an inhibitor of aromatase in breast cancer [19]. Therefore, we examined its potent therapeutic effects in human endometriosis. Similar to previous studies, in this study, 6,8-diprenylorobol affected cell survival in human endometriosis-like cells, with various changes in the intracellular organelles and levels of signaling proteins.', 'Calcium (Ca^2+) signaling regulates various physiological processes; the intracellular calcium ion level is critical for cell survival, cell function, and mitochondrial dynamics. It is known that intracellular calcium regulates various cellular functions, such as mitochondrial metabolism and cell proliferation [20]. Ca^2+ mainly forms a complex to regulate cell proliferation and death, and Ca^2+ regulates the cell cycle through the G1 checkpoint, G2/M, and spindle assembly checkpoints [21]. Any change in the process can lead to cell cycle arrest and death [22]. Increased cytosolic calcium stimulates calcium-sensitive proteins to propagate signals, and affects cell survival as well. In the present study, 6,8-diprenylorobol induced antiproliferative effects with cell cycle arrest in VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells. In addition, calcium could stimulate transcription through the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the presence of CaM II and CaMK IV in the nucleus [23,24]. Therefore, calcium was excessively accumulated when losing the MMP, and finally, apoptosis was induced [25,26]. Similarly, 6,8-diprenylorobol induced the depolarization of mitochondrial membranes and calcium overload in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix in this study. To verify the specific mechanism of 6,8-diprenylorobol in calcium homeostasis, we utilized two types of calcium inhibitors, 2-APB and RUR. The 2-APB inhibited the IP3 receptor through membrane penetration of the calcium storage other than mitochondria [27,28,29]. Ruthenium red is an inhibitor of the mitochondrial matrix calcium uniporter, and it inhibits calcium uptake into the mitochondrial matrix [30,31]. In the present study, we confirmed that the excessive calcium accumulation by 6,8-diprenylorobol was diminished with 2-APB treatment. Therefore, we found that 6,8-diprenylorobol influenced calcium regulation through IP3 receptors in human endometriosis-like cells.', 'Mitochondria play an important role in various cell functions with energy production. They produce cellular energy through oxidative oxidation (OXPHOS), and the OXPHOS complex comprises mitochondrial complexes I-V. The maximal capacity of cellular oxidative phosphorylation is an important determinant of cell survival [32], and functional impairment of mitochondrial complex I has been associated with various human diseases. Recently, a few mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in complex I subunit encoding genes were observed in endometriosis patients. These mutations affect the normal electron transport chains and increase ROS production, which is one of the causes of endometriosis [33]. These results suggested that cellular respiration by mitochondria plays an important role during the pathogenesis and development of endometriosis. Currently, it has been reported that several drugs acting on the mitochondrial electron transport chain exhibited anticancer effects [34,35]. While few such studies have been conducted on endometriosis, we confirmed that mitochondrial dysfunction was related to mitochondrial respiration and metabolism through this study. Therefore, we speculated that mitochondrial respiration will affect the treatment mechanism of endometriosis, based on the results of previous studies and this study. Therefore, this study confirmed that 6,8-diprenylorobol affected cellular energy production with lower mitochondrial respiration.', 'PI3K is a known major regulator for cell survival and apoptosis [36]. Therefore, downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is generally suggested as a therapeutic target for cancer diseases [37,38]. Although few studies have been conducted on PI3K/AKT in endometriosis [39], in one of the previous studies, phosphorylated AKT was observed in postmenopausal women with ovarian endometriosis [40], and phosphorylated mTOR was increased in ectopic lesions [41]. In the same context as prior studies, the results of this study indicated PI3K/AKT protein downregulation by 6,8-diprenylorobol with or without LY294002 in human endometriosis-like cell lines. In addition, temsirolimus, an mTOR drug that has exhibited the potential to reduce the size of endometrial lesions in vitro and in vivo, is currently approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma [42]. These results powerfully supported that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT cell signaling pathway with 6,8-diprenylorobol can be a potential target in the treatment of endometriosis.', 'Our study included only cellular experiments without any animal or clinical trials yet. However, our in-depth study of the molecular mechanisms regulating the anti-cell-growth effects of 6,8-diprenylorobol on endometriosis could be a cornerstone for further studies. With further verification, 6,8-diprenylorobol might be used as a therapeutic agent in endometriosis progression.', 'The 6,8-diprenylorobol inhibited cell proliferation, with cell cycle arrest and calcium dysregulation via IP3 signaling. In addition, the PI3K/AKT proliferative cell signaling pathway was effectively decreased by 6,8-diprenylorobol. In addition, the increased P38 protein levels suppressed the cell viability of endometriosis-like cells. Moreover, the malfunction of the mitochondria, including loss of MMP, cellular respiration, and energy production, was mediated by 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment in the VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cell lines. All these results indicated the therapeutic potential of 6,8-diprenylorobol in human endometriosis.']"

The aim of the present study was to investigate functions and pathways associated with the various miRNAs differentially expressed in patients with endometriosis. Plasma samples of the 200 patients from the prospective """"ENDO-miRNA"""" study were analyzed and all known human miRNAs were sequenced. For each miRNA, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC values were calculated for the diagnosis of endometriosis. miRNAs with an AUC ≥ 0.6 were selected for further analysis. A comprehensive review of recent articles from the PubMed, Clinical Trials.gov, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was performed to identify functions and pathways associated with the selected miRNAs. In total, 2633 miRNAs were found in the patients with endometriosis. Among the 57 miRNAs with an AUC ≥ 0.6: 20 had never been reported before; one (miR-124-3p) had previously been observed in endometriosis; and the remaining 36 had been reported in benign and malignant disorders. miR-124-3p is involved in ectopic endometrial cell proliferation and invasion and plays a role in the following pathways: mTOR, STAT3, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, ERK, PLGF-ROS, FGF2-FGFR, MAPK, GSK3B/β-catenin. Most of the remaining 36 miRNAs are involved in carcinogenesis through cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion. The three main pathways involved are Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, and NF-KB. Our results provide evidence of the relation between the miRNA profiles of patients with endometriosis and various signaling pathways implicated in its pathophysiology.","['Endometriosis, defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, affects 5-10% of women of reproductive age, but is also diagnosed in menopausal patients with an incidence estimated at 2-5% [1,2]. In the premenopausal period, diagnosis is mainly based on symptoms including severe chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, and infertility. However, no single sign is sufficiently characteristic to make a diagnosis. In postmenopausal patients, endometriosis can be symptomatic but is also diagnosed in a context associated with, or mimicking, a cancer. From the pathophysiology point of view, endometriosis is considered a multifactorial disease with genetic and epigenetic controls involving multiple pathways such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, angiogenesis, steroidogenesis, inflammatory and immune responses, oncogenic suppressors, as well as exposome factors, particularly persistent organic pollutants (POP) [3]. However, despite numerous investigations of these various pathways, the pathophysiology of endometriosis remains an enigma.', ""Human miRNAs are single-stranded highly conserved non-coding RNAs composed of 21-25 nucleotides binding to their complementary mRNAs regulating their degradation and translation [4,5]. It is estimated that about 60% of genes are regulated by miRNAs [6,7]. Cumulative evidence suggests that miRNA dysregulation plays a pivotal role in many benign and malignant disorders, as well as in endometriosis which shares features of both pathologies. More than 2600 miRNAs have been identified in humans to date. Evaluation of these miRNAs in patients with endometriosis has shown that more than 200 are differentially expressed in patients with and without endometriosis [8,9,10] with some literature on their relevance in endometriosis' diagnostic [11,12,13]. Among these 200 miRNAs, only a few have been analyzed with a view to better understanding the pathophysiology of endometriosis [14,15]."", 'Therefore, using data from the prospective """"ENDOmiRNA"""" study [16], the aim of the present work was to investigate functions and pathways associated with the various miRNAs differentially expressed in patients with and without endometriosis to highlight new potential fields for research and treatments.', 'We used data from the prospective """"ENDOmiARN"""" study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04728152). Data collection and analysis were carried out under the Research Protocol n^0 ID RCB: 2020-A03297-32. The ENDOmiARN study included 200 plasma samples obtained from patients with chronic pelvic pain suggestive of endometriosis. All had undergone a laparoscopic procedure (either therapeutic or diagnostic laparoscopic) and/or MRI imaging evidencing endometriosis by the presence of endometrioma and/or deep endometriosis [17,18,19], as stated in the trial registration. The laparoscopy procedures were systematically recorded and the video analyzed by two operators (CT, YD), who were blind to the symptoms and imaging findings, to confirm the presence or absence of endometriosis. All patients undergoing diagnostic or operative laparoscopy underwent a systematic histological confirmation of endometriosis when potential lesions were present. For the patients in the endometriosis group without laparoscopic evaluation, all had MRI features of deep endometriosis with colorectal involvement and/or endometrioma have been revised in the multidisciplinary endometriosis committee. All the plasma samples were collected between January 2021 and June 2021. All samples were collected at the first consultation, prior to laparoscopy (in patients that underwent surgery). Analysis was performed blinded to the surgical and imaging findings. If endometriosis was detected, the subjects were stratified according to the revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) classification [20].', 'Blood samples (4 mL) were collected in EDTA tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Besides its role in endometriosis, this miRNA is involved in cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, metastasis, and neurogenic functions. In addition, it has been associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition, promoting trophoblast cell pyroptosis, chemosensitivity, and bone formation (Table S3)."", 'The large majority of miRNAs differentially expressed in patients with and without endometriosis have not previously been identified as being involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis.

However, it is important to note that all the human miRNAs were detected in the blood of patients with endometriosis. This poses the challenge of which miRNAs deserve to be analyzed to better understand the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Previous studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of miRNAs to improve diagnosis, prediction and forecasting for numerous diseases mainly based on micro-array of miRNAs or NGS sequencing using bioinformatics platforms with a limited number of miRNA, imposing a validation by qRT-PCR [26]. Another crucial issue is to evaluate whether results of NGS require qRT-PCR validation. Previous studies have shown that absolute NGS reads correlated modestly with qRT-PCR but fold changes, as used in the current study, correlated highly supporting that NGS is robust at relative but not absolute quantification of miRNA [85,86,87,88]. Moreover, as previously demonstrated, the number of microRNAs detected in biofluids by NGS and qRT-PCR was similar after filtering the data and applying thresholds supporting our results. In addition, recent studies validated the use of NGS technology to improve the diagnosing of using saliva RNA or to predict concussion duration and detect symptom recovery after mild traumatic brain injury. In this setting, in accordance with 't Hoen et al. [89], bioinformatics allows the exhaustive analysis of all ARN fragments that are aligned and mapped, and their expression levels quantified, thus eliminating the need for sequence specific hybridization probes or qRT-PCR which are required in a microarray [26,90,91]. Moreover, NGS has the advantages of high sensitivity and resolution and excellent reproducibility but imposes considerable computational support [26,89,91]. So far, very few miRNAs (<300) have been used to determine the various biological mechanisms involved in the poorly understood and multifactorial pathophysiology of endometriosis. In the specific context of endometriosis, data from our prospective ENDOmiARN study [16] identified 57 miRNAs (2.2%) significantly expressed in patients with endometriosis with a diagnostic AUC of >=0.60, suggesting a potential contribution in the pathophysiology of the disease. One crucial result of the current study was the identification of 20 miRNAs significantly expressed in patients with endometriosis but not previously reported in either benign or malignant disorders. This highlights the need for more fundamental research investigating their role in the pathophysiologic process of endometriosis."", 'Among the 57 miRNAs differentially expressed in patients with endometriosis, only miR-124-3p has previously been reported in endometriosis. Interestingly, none of the miRNAs previously reported as potentially involved in endometriosis [10,92,93] were found to be a predictive marker of endometriosis in our cohort (i.e., with an AUC >=0.6). Another crucial result is the high number of miRNAs not previously reported in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Among these 57 miRNAs significantly expressed in patients with endometriosis, the vast majority have previously been detected in various cancers confirming that endometriosis shares several signaling pathways with carcinogenesis [94]. Overall, the miRNA-548 family seems to play a determinant role in endometriosis. Of the eight identified members of the miRNA-548 family, one has not been reported before (miR-548j-5p), three have been reported in carcinogenesis (miR-548p; miR-548l; miR-548b-3p) [66,67,68,69,70,71,72,95,96], and the remaining four (miR-548ah-3p; miR-548q; miR-548f-5p; miR-548ay-3p) are known to be involved in diabetic nephropathy, weight loss, circadian rhythm and smooth muscle contraction [97,98,99,100]. When analyzing the potential contribution of each miRNA in the pathophysiology of endometriosis, it is important to note that a single miRNA could be involved in multiple signaling pathways. The translational regulation by miRNAs involves intricately regulated composite interactions in which a single miRNA regulates the transcription of many mRNAs, and a single mRNA can be influenced by multiple miRNAs. The expression of miRNA in an individual is dynamic and is influenced by an array of factors, including age, ethnicity, the physiological stage of the body, the presence of various diseases, smoking, and various other external factors [93,94].', 'As mentioned above, the pathophysiology of endometriosis involves numerous signaling pathways which we cannot develop in a single report. In the present study, we did not perform experimental confirmation of the pathways potentially regulated by the miRNAs identified. Instead, we performed extensive literature research to set the basis for further well-designed works that will confirm the roles of the main miRNAs in the physiopathology of endometriosis. However, our work highlights the similar pathophysiological pathways involved in endometriosis and cancer genesis, with most miRNAs regulating cell proliferation (22 miRNAs), apoptosis (16 miRNAs), and adhesion/invasion (16 miRNAs). These three pathways could be determinant to promote endometriosis confirming preliminary analysis by Panir et al. [8]. These pathways compete with inflammation to promote endometriosis, although only four miRNAs have been directly linked to inflammation. Moreover, the contribution of angiogenesis and immune response has been underlined (5 miRNAs each). All these data reinforce the concept that endometriosis shares several signaling pathways of carcinogenesis.', 'Among the various pathways implicated in endometriosis, hypoxia plays a specific role in early phases of ectopic endometrial tissue survival induced by factor 1- (HIF-1) gene expression that is upregulated in endometriotic tissues [101]. Aberrant immune surveillance is thought to reduce the clearance of endometrial cells within the peritoneal cavity, permitting attachment, progression, and subsequent disease persistence [102,103]. The inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1B) [104], TNF [105,106], and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 [107] can be targeted by miRNAs in endometrial tissue. Lagana et al. reported the variation of the balance through the course of the disease between macrophages type 1 (pro-inflammatory) and 2 (pro fibrosis) that could be involved in the pathogenesis [108]. In our cohort, two identified miRNAs were associated with macrophages expression: miR-144 and miR-421. This latter was reported in the inflammatory process [109]. Aberrant estrogen and progesterone biosynthesis and metabolism contribute to the development of endometriosis [109] by increasing local estrogen production and promoting endometriosis development. Increased miR-142-3p seems to reduce steroid sulfatase and IL-6 activity, suggesting a dual effect on steroidogenic and inflammatory pathways in endometriosis [110]. Previous studies have shown a high expression of miR-210 increasing proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to apoptosis [111], whereas upregulation of miR-196 increases proliferation and anti-apoptotic mechanisms [112]. There are evidence that matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) also play a crucial role. Indeed, miR-520g acts on MMP2 synthesis that could act to enhance the degradation of the extracellular matrix and facilitate the anchoring of endometrial fragments in ectopic sites [113,114].', 'Although previous epidemiologic studies using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have demonstrated the involvement of POPs in endometriosis, little data are available about their impact on miRNA expression in endometriosis. In the current study, we found two miRNAs significantly associated with pollutants: miR-421 (previously described in light pollution) and miR-542-5p (previously described in pulmonary fibrosis secondary to silicosis). Moreover, one miRNA (miR-548ay-3p) was previously found to regulate the circadian rhythm [100]. All these data underline the need to investigate other potential factors involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis besides the classic POPs (octachlorodibenzofuran, cis-heptachlor epoxide, polychlorinated biphenyl 77, or trans-nonachlor) [3].', ""We focused our analysis on a few frequently observed specific pathways which may have a therapeutic impact, such as the Wnt/-catenin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, HOXA11, and Hippo pathways. To date, the main therapeutic options for patients with endometriosis are based on gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (as endometriosis is a well-known hormone-dependent pathology) or angiogenesis inhibitors but with inconsistent results [115,116,117,118,119,120]. The Wnt/-catenin pathway: It has been demonstrated that Wnt signals are crucial for the activity of epithelial stem cells. The loss of the APC tumor suppressor gene function may lead to the deregulation of -catenin stability [121]. Various targets activating or inhibiting Wnt signaling have been published (Porcupine, vacuolar ATPase, tankyrase Axin, PP2A, ARFGAP1 and GSK3) [122]. Moreover, soluble Wnt protein agonists have been shown to activate Wnt signaling in vivo [123] and several small molecule compounds (L807mts, Bio, CHIR, and SB-216763) [124] interfere with GSK3 and thus induce Wnt target gene expression. This could be of interest in the development of treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease [125]. The Hippo pathway: The Hippo pathway has been shown to play a role in organ development, epithelial homeostasis, tissue regeneration, wound healing, immune modulation, as well as fibrosis that characterizes deep endometriosis [126]. Many of these roles are mediated by the transcriptional effectors YAP and TAZ [127,128]. The YAP/TAZ complex regulates pro-fibrotic factors and interferes with small-molecule inhibitors of PAI-1 and converges with pro-fibrotic signaling pathways such as TGF previously described in endometriosis [129]. Recently, verteporfin and VGLL4 mimetic peptides have been shown to inhibit YAP/TAZ-dependent transcription as well as suppress tumor growth. Thus, therapies targeting this transcription could potentially result in treatments for various diseases [130,131]. HOXA11: Long non-coding RNA HOXA11-AS has been shown to regulate target genes by epigenetic methylation and has been found to inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway via the upregulation of HOXA11, thus inhibiting proliferation and invasion properties [132]. Moreover, it has been found that overexpression of HOXA11-AS increases the membrane levels of CD44 [133] and decreases the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 [134], MMP-9, and vascular endothelial growth factors that are dysregulated in endometriosis. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: Previous studies have demonstrated that this pathway can modulate proliferation and angiogenesis in endometriosis [135], and that two rapamycin-analogues (temsirolimus and everolimus), already used in various cancers, inhibit mTOR signaling and reduce the growth of endometriosis implants [136]."", 'Some limits of our study deserve to be underlined. First, in the present miRNAs analysis, we adopted as normalization thresholds read >1.5-fold as up-regulation and <0.5 downregulation which could be debated. However, this is in line which previous publications in the endometriosis fields [8,10,92]. Second, a surprising result of our work was the absence in the highly valuable miRNA of some miRNA previously reported as significant before [11,12,137,138,139,140,141]. This could be explained by the size of our cohort being much larger, which necessarily had an impact on the individual value of diagnostic performance for a single miRNA. Third, we focused on miRNAs with an accuracy >=0.60, but it is not possible to rule out that some miRNAs with an accuracy between 0.50 and 0.59 might play a role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. However, among the 2633 miRNAs detected in patients with endometriosis, 2077 had an AUC >b0.50 and <0.60. We would not have been able to comprehensively investigate all the signaling pathways potentially involved in endometriosis in a single report. Fourth, we only focused on miRNA expression, although several studies have demonstrated that other non-coding RNAs may play a role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Fifth, several reports underlined the potential impact of the menstrual cycle and the hormonal treatment on the miRNA expression, especially when endometrium samples have been analyzed [142,143]. In our cohort, a correlation was noted for two miRNAs (miR-548p and miR-548l) with the use of hormonal therapy which is conflicting with the results reported by the two aforementioned studies by Vanhie et al. and Moustafa et al. that found no impact of either treatment or menstrual phase on miRNAs levels. In addition, numerous other conditions may impact the expression level on miRNA, such as the endometriosis stage, age, BMI, tobacco and hormonal treatment use. Here, we reported the expression level for the six most accurate miRNA and demonstrated a low impact of such characteristics [10,92]. Sixth, we have not performed subgroup analysis to investigate the potential influence of miRNA expression in minimal cases to evolve toward severe endometriosis. This could be relevant, especially when further bench work will have deeply studied the miRNA identified as highly expressed in our cohort. Finally, due to the numerous pathways involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis, we only focused on the most frequently observed, representing a true limit. However, all these data underline the need of further in vivo and in vitro analysis to confirm the pivotal role of miRNAs in endometriosis.', 'Our results provide evidence of the relation between miRNA profiles in patients with endometriosis and various signaling pathways implicated in its pathophysiology. In addition, the analysis of the miRNAome opens up new perspectives of investigation in the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms involved not only in endometriosis but also in other pathologies qualified as multifactorial.']"

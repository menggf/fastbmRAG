One proposed mechanism is through chronic inflammation. The objective of this study was to examine the association between endometriosis and uterine fibroids and biomarkers of inflammation and cellular aging. Materials and Methods: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2342; 1999-2002). Adjusted logistic and linear regression were used to examine the association between these two reproductive conditions and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; >3.0 mg/L) and leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio), respectively. Given that a greater length of time spent with a condition may represent persistence of an inflammatory process, we further examined the association between time since disease diagnosis on telomere length among the subset of women with diagnosed endometriosis and fibroids. Results: Women with endometriosis had greater odds of having elevated CRP than those without endometriosis (OR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.45). Women with endometriosis had a shorter telomere length than women without endometriosis (-3.4, 95% CI: -7.3 to -0.3 in age-adjusted models and -2.9, 95% CI: -8.8 to 3.5 in fully adjusted models). Telomeres were 1% (95% CI: -1.2 to -0.6) shorter for every elapsed year since endometriosis diagnosis. No substantive patterns emerged between uterine fibroids and CRP or telomere length. Conclusions: Women with endometriosis (or a longer duration of time spent with endometriosis) had higher inflammatory markers and shorter mean telomere length. These results provide further insights into potential mechanisms linking endometriosis to chronic disease and later-life health.",

Exposition to estrogen-like endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been reported to contribute to the fetal origin of this disease.|We report here an informative family in which all prenatally DES-exposed daughters and subsequent granddaughters presented endometriosis, whereas the unexposed first daughter and her progeny presented no gynecological disorders. Moreover, the only post-pubertal great-granddaughter, who presents chronic dysmenorrhea that remains resistant to conventional therapy, is at risk of developing endometriosis. The mother (I-2) was prescribed DES (30 mg/day for 3 months) to inhibit lactation after each delivery.|Although a direct causal link between the grandmother's treatment with DES and the development of endometriosis in possibly three exposed generations remains speculative, this report strengthens the suspicion that fetal exposition to DES contributes to the pathogenesis of adult diseases, such as endometriosis. It also highlights a multigenerational and likely transgenerational effect of EDCs.","Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven condition characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, most commonly engrafted within the peritoneal cavity secondary to retrograde menstruation. It affects 10 to 15 % of the women of reproductive age, often resulting in severe, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia and altered fertility [1].
The pathophysiology of endometriosis stems from a broad spectrum of genetic factors and environmental influences [2]. Retrograde menstruation is influenced by a genetic predisposition and is involved in inflammation, angiogenesis and vascularization processes [3, 4]. Other factors such as oxidative stress, resistance to apoptosis and immunological dysregulation also contribute to this disease [4].
Environmental factors also exert a considerable impact through epigenetic mechanisms [5]. Increased estrogen activity during fetal life seems to be an important factor of endometriosis onset and progression [6], and epidemiological studies supports a higher rate of endometriosis among women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero [7-11]. In particular, Missmer et al. reported, in a prospective study on a population of 84,446 premenopausal women, 1,226 cases of self-reported laparoscopically-confirmed endometriosis with no past infertility and found that the rate of endometriosis was 80 % greater among women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero (RR 1.8, CI 1.2-2.8) [7, 11]. Upson et al. carried a population-based case-control study composed by 310 cases and 727 controls and suggested increased endometriosis risk with maternal use of DES (OR 2.0, 95 % CI 0.8-4.9), although not statistically significant [8]. Ottolina et al. performed a meta-analysis based on Missmer's and Upson's studies and the pooled results showed that DES significantly increased the risk of developing endometriosis (RR 1.92, 95 % CI 1.30 to 2.83), with non-significant heterogeneity among the studies (P = 0.98) [9]. Last, Wolff et al. performed a cohort study in which an operative cohort, composed by 473 women undergoing laparoscopy/laparotomy, was matched to an age- and residence-matched population cohort, comprising 127 women undergoing pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [10]. The authors found that none of the women in the population cohort reported DES exposure, in contrast to 2 % of women in the operative cohort; however, within the cohort of women undergoing laparoscopy/laparotomy, the prevalence of prenatal DES exposure was almost identical [10]. Moreover, the link between endometriosis and fetal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with estrogen-like activity, such as dioxins, organochlorine pesticides, bisphenols and phthalates, has been established by several investigators [11, 12]. All together, these data suggest a developmental or in utero origin of this disease [13].
We had the opportunity to manage an informative family with endometriosis occurring in the second and third generations of a woman who took DES for cessation of breast feeding after each of her 10 pregnancies. All 6 daughters exposed in utero by DES presented endometriosis and all their female offspring did, as well.
This observation strongly supports the possible relationship between prenatal exposure to DES and subsequent development of endometriosis, as reported by other authors [7-9, 14]. In addition, it reinforces the suspicion of a multigenerational (and likely transgenerational) effect of DES and other EDCs in human diseases [15-22].
We report on a single family of Caucasian origin with 2 (and likely 3) generations affected by endometriosis (see pedigree, Fig 1). The index case (II-7) joined the French association of DES-treated women (HHORAGES Association), reporting laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. The family history revealed other family members with the same disease.
The mother (I-2) from Canada presented no symptoms of endometriosis, nor other gynecological disorders. She had worked as a waitress and then as a nurse until retirement. The father (I-1) had been a miller and then a primary school teacher until retirement. They had 11 full-term children (one twin pregnancy). The mother (I-2) was thus gravida/para/abortion (GPA) G10 P11 A0. She underwent surgery (3 times) for recurrent benign breast tumors. She also presented severe Basedow disease and died at 80 years old from complications of vascular dementia. The mother (I-2) had 2 half-sisters and the father (I-1) had 3 sisters. No one in the extended family presented symptoms of endometriosis, infertility or breast or genital cancers.
DES (30 mg/day PO) was systematically prescribed, by the same gynecologist, to the mother for voluntary suppression of puerperal lactation for aesthetic reasons for 3 months after each delivery, starting from the first one. The medication adherence was complete. The first child (II-1) was thus not exposed to DES, since the mother started DES treatment after her birth. The first child (II-1) was a daughter and presented no symptoms of endometriosis or infertility. All the following daughters of the second generation (II-4, II-6, II-7, II-8, II-9, II-10) presented chronic dysmenorrhea treated with analgesic drugs and oral contraceptive pills (OCP) and had laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis. In addition, II-6, II-7 and II-9 presented repetitive miscarriages, II-6 aborted an anencephalic fetus (III-12), and II-8 gave birth to 2 very premature children; the first died at 3 days (III-17) and the second (III-20) survived.
Regarding the third generation, all the females born to the affected daughters of the second generation (III-10, III-16, III-18, III-19, III-20, III-24, III-25) presented chronic dysmenorrhea treated with painkillers and OCP and were noninvasively diagnosed with endometriosis (transvaginal ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging: MRI). It should be noted that none of the daughters born to the only unexposed female (II-1) presented symptoms of endometriosis.
In the fourth generation, IV-5 is the only great-grandchild who has attained menarche. She is now 15 years old and since menarche has presented severe, chronic dysmenorrhea, resistant to treatment.
Interestingly, III-11 and III-13 presented hyspospadias.
The extended family presented no occupational or environmental exposure to EDCs, except for III-25 (aesthetician).
The family members, now spread over Europe and Canada, declined to offer permission for molecular investigations.
We report here an informative family in which all prenatally DES-exposed daughters and subsequent granddaughters presented endometriosis, whereas the unexposed first daughter and her progeny presented no gynecological disorders. To our knowledge, this familial expression of endometriosis in 2 generations, and likely 3 generations, associated with DES exposure has never been reported.
The mother (I-2) was systematically prescribed DES (30 mg/day PO for 3 months) to inhibit lactation after each delivery. The frequency of DES treatment prescribed to stop lactation after delivery was not yet documented in the scientific literature and, to our knowledge, no study reported its impact on the development of children born after such treatment. Earlier studies on the pharmacodynamics of DES in mammals reported that 120 days after ^14 C-DES treatment, DES concentration was measurable in the liver [23]. Since the biological disposition of DES in humans is not extensively different from that observed in laboratory animals, it is likely that the mother's pregnancies started under DES exposure as the interpregnancy intervals, for daughters, ranged between 3 and 8 months. Whether there would be enough DES remaining in the body to affect these pregnancies, this point constitutes a potential limitation. Actually, DES is mainly metabolized to its catechol quinone, which reacts with DNA to form adducts [24] that are stored in adipose tissue. Its overall accumulation may have induced exposure that lasted up to the beginning of each new gestation after the first. Besides, quinones are considered as deleterious disruptors during development, inducing severe modifications into single or double DNA strands during their metabolization [25], genotoxic effects occurring transplacentally on exposed fetus [26]. In addition, they are known to be able to induce specific genotoxic link to DNA [24] and likely all along several generations [27], reinforcing the suspicion of a multigenerational (and likely transgenerational) transmission of endometriosis in this informative family.
Endometriosis is known to have familial components, with the total risk of endometriosis in first-degree patients' relatives increased up to 10.2 % versus 0.7 % in controls [28]. A recent meta-analysis identified 5 loci regulating steroid hormone pathways [29], 5 transduction signals and 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with endometriosis [30]. We were unfortunately unable to collect blood DNA from this family to investigate single nucleotide gene polymorphisms. However, no mutations strongly associated with disease risk were identified in family-based or case control linkage and candidate gene studies of endometriosis [2, 31, 32].
In addition, a growing body of literature has focused on the association between endometriosis and exposure to DES and other EDCs with estrogen-like activity [6-11]. In immortalized human endometrial cell lines, Bruner et al. partially elucidated the mechanistic processes that link EDCs and endometriosis, such as steroidogenic factor 1 gene (SF-1) overexpression causing excessive production of estrogen via high levels of ER-, progesterone resistance, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory conditions, which are thought to be involved in the migration, adhesion and progression of endometrial tissues [33]. Moreover, DES has been reported to induce epigenetic changes: many animal studies have identified DES exposure-related epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation changes [34-38], although the results of human studies remain partially inconclusive [39, 40].
In this family, a direct causal link between the mother's treatment with DES and the development of endometriosis in all prenatally DES-exposed daughters and subsequent granddaughters cannot be demonstrated and thus remains speculative. Whether there would be enough DES remaining in the body to affect these pregnancies and it might be helpful to add this as a potential limitation.
Nevertheless, the absence of endometriosis in the first unexposed daughter and her progeny indirectly suggests the key role of environmental influences. Since no single genetic abnormality can predict the development of endometriosis in all exposed daughters, DES was probably the major risk factor for the endometriosis present in all 6 daughters exposed during fetal life and the 7 granddaughters born to the affected daughters, suggesting a multigenerational impact of DES. Moreover, regarding the only post-pubertal great-granddaughter, even though a diagnosis of endometriosis has not yet been confirmed, clinicians suspect that the persistent, severe, drug-resistant dysmenorrhea is actually hiding endometriosis in this adolescent. If this is confirmed, it will provide powerful support for the suspected transgenerational effect of DES and EDCs in humans.
Only a few studies have considered DES and its multigenerational outcomes [41]. We and others have reported an increased risk of hypospadias in sons of DES daughters [15-18] and, interestingly, III-11 and III-13 presented hypospadias. Titus et al. found delayed menstrual regularization, higher odds of irregular menstrual periods and amenorrhea, and an increased risk of preterm delivery and fewer live births among women whose mothers were exposed in utero to DES [19, 42], as well as a higher rate of birth defects in DES grandchildren [20]. We recently reported primary clear cell carcinoma of the cervix in an 8-year-old DES granddaughter as possible evidence of multigenerational transmission of DES [21]. In addition, Kioumourtzoglou et al. provided evidence that DES exposure was associated with multigenerational neurodevelopmental deficits, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [22].
This informative family highlights, for the first time, suspicion of the multigenerational and possible transgenerational effect of DES in endometriosis. It strengthens the body of work suggesting the role of fetal exposure to EDCs in the pathogenesis of adult reproductive disease."

5882,34469331,2022,The American journal of surgical pathology,5.6,Yolk Sac Tumor of the Ovary: A Report of 150 Cases and Review of the Literature.,"One hundred fifty yolk sac tumors (YSTs) of the ovary in patients from 1 to 61 (mean: 21.5) years of age are described; 75% of the patients were in the second and third decades and only 1 was above 50 years of age. The clinical manifestations were typically related to a fast-growing adnexal mass; endocrine manifestations (hirsutism) were present in only 2 cases. The tumors were all unilateral and 70% were ≥15 cm; an associated dermoid cyst was present in 20 cases. The tumors were solid and cystic in 57% of the cases, 25% were multicystic, and 18% uniformly solid. The solid tissue was typically tan to pink or yellow and often friable with hemorrhage and necrosis; smaller solid neoplasms were sometime uniformly yellow. The most common histologic pattern was reticular composed of an irregular meshwork of spaces that was conspicuous in 68% of the neoplasms but present to at least a minor degree in all of them. That appearance almost always merged with small to large cysts that were prominent in about 40% of tumors. In 25% of the tumors, cysts sometimes associated with a cellular stroma (the polyvesicular pattern), were present but conspicuous in only half these cases. One third of the tumors had a labyrinthine pattern, 22% glands, and 6% a festoon pattern. Papillae with a central blood vessel (Schiller-Duval bodies) were seen in one-third of the tumors but were numerous in only 5% of them. Nonspecific appearing papillae were seen in 10% of the tumors. A solid growth of cells with pale cytoplasm was seen in one-third of the tumors but was conspicuous in only half of that subset. The solid appearance was typically reminiscent of that of dysgerminoma, but lacked the septa and lymphocytic infiltrate of that neoplasm. Nine tumors had a component of cells with scant cytoplasm resulting in a blastema-like appearance and 3 had cells with abundant clear cytoplasm. Cords and clusters of cells were common but did not dominate the microscopic appearance. The stroma typically had a nonspecific collagenous to edematous appearance. Stromal luteinization was seen in 12 tumors; in 5 this was likely due to the patient being pregnant. Two tumors had minor foci of cells that resembled hepatocytes. Hyaline bodies were seen in most of the tumors and were often conspicuous. The neoplastic cells typically had modest amounts of lightly staining cytoplasm and only mild nuclear pleomorphism. Cells lining cysts were often flattened sometimes resulting in a deceptively innocuous appearance. Many of the tumors (mostly consultation cases), caused diagnostic difficulty; tumors in the differential diagnosis included clear cell carcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, and juvenile granulosa cell tumor. The patient age and marked elevation of the serum alpha-fetoprotein level (if measured) is helpful in many of these considerations. The overtly malignant gross appearance of most YSTs contrasts with certain other tumors in the differential and the association of some YSTs with dermoid cyst and many clear cell carcinomas with endometriosis may be helpful. The vast majority of ovarian YSTs are dominated microscopically by merging of reticular and cystic patterns which, although focally mimicked by other neoplasms, are in general characteristic, and distinctive features of other neoplasms are absent. Immunohistochemistry, particularly for alpha-fetoprotein and glypican 3, and lack of staining for various markers of other neoplasms is helpful but overlap exists and these results must be considered in the context of the overall clinical, gross, and microscopic features. YSTs dominated by hepatoid and glandular features are rare and their categorization as YSTs should be done cautiously if thoroughly sampled tumors show no evidence of classic features of YST emphasized herein and first elaborated by the Danish investigator Gunnar Teilum whose seminal observations have stood the test of time.",

The success rate of pregnancy in women with endometriosis who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) was 54% compared with infertile women due to tubal abnormalities [1]. Compared with other causes of infertility (e.g. tubal abnormalities and unexplained infertility), moderate endometriosis results in low pregnancy success and a high incidence of abortion [2]. Endometriosis has a negative impact on all markers of the infertility process in women who are participating in IVF programs [1], so there is a suspicion that endometriosis has a negative impact on the functions of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes and the ability of the uterus to accept conception [3]. Observations on IVF results using oocyte donors have proven the suspicion that endometriosis affects the ovaries and decreases the quality of oocytes during endometrial receptivity [4]. However, until now, the exact mechanism of folliculogenesis disturbance, which decreases oocyte quality in infertile patients with endometriosis, remains unclear.
The latest consensus on the pathogenesis of endometriosis has stated that endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory process in the pelvis that increases the function of immunological cells in the peritoneal fluid, which is unusual and is closely related to the growth and development of endometriosis, and affects the quality of the oocytes produced [5-9]. Endometriosis could also increase the apoptosis of granulosa cells; thus, it can affect the process of folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis [10]. The concentrations of pro-inflammatory interleukins (ILs) (i.e. IL-6, IL-1, and IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) were increased in patients with endometriosis. TNF- concentration in the follicular flow of patients with endometriosis who have poor oocyte quality [3] is thought to trigger the secretion of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, which ultimately interfere with the process of oocyte fertilization. TNF- plays a biological role as a pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and apoptotic agent through activated caspase-8, which activates caspase-3, and the apoptotic pathway begins [11].
Some previous studies [12,13] using stem cells to determine a decrease in apoptosis of granulosa cells in the ovaries of experimental animals given cytostatic have been conducted. These studies have shown the success of stem cell therapy for improving ovarian function. In this study, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were used because they have been widely used for therapy. Besides, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are a type of adult stem cell; thus, they have a small chance of becoming tumors compared with embryonic stem cells.
This study aimed to determine the effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) receptor 1 (TNFR1) expression, granulosa cell apoptosis, and folliculogenesis in endometriosis mouse models. , We used the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) endometriosis model (which has reduced immune function) as the study sample due to research ethics constraints.
This type of study is explanatory research with pure experiments (true experiments) carried out in the experimental animal laboratory. This research has obtained ethical eligibility with ethics certificate number: 685-KE-2018.
The study was carried out from May to July 2017 at the Stem Cell Laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Disease, Universitas Airlangga, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universitas Airlangga and Cellular Biology Laboratory, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Brawijaya.
Bone marrow stem cells were obtained from female mice aged 3 months with a weight of 20-40 g. Under local anesthesia, the bone marrow aspirate was collected from the tibia using 5-10 mouse donors to reach 3 mL bone marrow and then placed into a 15 mL heparin tube containing 3 mL minimum essential medium-alpha (ratio 1:1) (Invitrogen, USA). The tubes were stored in the refrigerator before service. Each aspirate was transferred into a 15 mL blue cap tube and diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma, USA). Each tube was processed with 5 mL PBS twice. Then, each aspirate was mixed and coated with Ficoll (G.E Healthcare, UK). The tubes were centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 15 min; then, the buffy coat located on Ficoll PBS was collected using a Pasteur pipette, and the cells were placed in a 15 mL tube. After that, each sample was diluted with PBS, mixed 3-5 times, and centrifuged again at 1600 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were resuspended with 6 mL completed culture medium (CCM) (Invitrogen, USA). The cells were placed on a 5 cm^2 plate and incubated with 5% CO_2 humidity for 24 h. After 24 h, 2 mL PBS was added to the culture, which was washed twice. Then, 10 mL CCM was added, and the culture was incubated at 37^0C humidity 5% CO_2 for 5-10 days. Daily examinations were performed using an electron microscope. Every 3 days, the cells were washed with PBS 5% or 10%, and 10 mL CCM was added. The process was continued until the cells were between 60% and 80% confluent. Then, the passage is performed every 5 days until it reached passage four. After the stem cells from the bone marrow have been isolated, the next step is characterization to identify these stem cells. Stem cell identification through the genotypic approach using specific primers is known as the polymerase chain reaction approach. In preparing the stem stage, the expression of negative CD45 and positive CD73, CD90, and CD105 was characterized to ensure that the stem cells inserted were mesenchymal [14-18].
Female mice aged 3 months with a weight of 20-40 g were adapted for 1 week in a clean cage with enough air, enough light, and adequate and homogeneous eating and drinking. The mice were randomly divided into three groups, each of which consisted of 14 mice: T0 group: Negative control group; T1 group: The positive control group (the group of endometriosis mouse models that received placebo); and T2 group: The treatment group (endometriosis mouse models that received bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells) [19].
The endometriosis model group of mice was intramuscularly injected with cyclosporine A (Sandimmune; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) at a dose of 10 mg/body weight and estrogen. Endometriosis modeling using female mice aged approximately 12 weeks, weighing 20-40 g with 1 week of adaptation was performed by intramuscularly injecting 0.2 mL/mice cyclosporin A (Sandimmune; North Ryde, Australia), intraperitoneally injecting endometrial isolate (0.1 mL of human endometrial tissue has been transferred/injected to SCID mice), and intramuscularly injecting estrogen (a conversion dose of 5.4 mgr for each mouse [1 mgr equivalent to 10 IU]) on day 1. Estrogen injection was continued from day 2 until day 5. On day 14, the endometriosis model was complete, which was characterized by the growth of endometriosis tissue in the peritoneum. A single dose of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was administered on day 15 with a dosage of 10^6/mice. On day 29, sample collection was performed [19,20].
The sliced ovarian tissue was deparaffinated (paraffin block) with xylene thrice for 3 min each. Rehydration preparations were performed using 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 70% ethanol for 2 min, 2 min, and 1 min, respectively, and finally using water for 1 min and then soaked in a peroxidase blocking solution at 27oC for 10 min. The preparations were incubated in a pre-dilution inhibitor serum at 25^0C for 10 min, soaked in 25^0C monoclonal anti-TNFR1 antibodies (ab58436) for 10 min, and washed with PBS for 5 min. The preparations were incubated with secondary antibodies (conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) at 25^0C for 10 min and then washed with PBS for 5 min. After that, they were incubated with 25^0C peroxidase for 10 min and washed with PBS for 5 min. The preparations were incubated with diaminobenzidine at 25^0C for 10 min, incubated with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) for 3 min, and washed with running water. Then, they were cleaned, dropped with mounting media, and then covered with a coverslip. The expression of TNFR1 (brown in color) observed on the cells using a light microscope with 400x, which was previously confirmed at 1000x. All these examinations used a Nikon H600L light microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 300 megapixel DS Fi2 digital camera and the Nikon Image System image processing software (Tokyo Japan). The semi-qualitative assessment of TNFR1 expression is based on Table-1 [21,22].
Paraffin block sections were dewaxed; then rehydrated with 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 70% ethanol and finally with water for 1 min; and then soaked in a 20 g/mL proteinase K (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 27oC for 15 min. The tissues were incubated with a solution containing 2% H_2O_2 in PBS to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity and then washed with PBS. The preparations were incubated in a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) buffer solution containing 0.3 U/l TdT (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and 0.04 nmoL/L digoxigenin-dUTP (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added to cover the tissues at 37^0C for 60 min. Then, the tissues were washed with 300 mm sodium chloride and 30 mm sodium citrate for 30 min and then washed with PBS for 5 min. The preparations were incubated with anti-digoxigenin-peroxidase complex for 30 min at 27^oC and stained with a solution of diaminobenzidine at 27^0C for 10 min. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls were obtained by omitting TdT from the buffer solution. The preparations were cleaned and dropped with mounting media and then covered with a coverslip. The expression of apoptosis cells (dark brown color) was observed using a light microscope with 400x, which was previously confirmed at 1000x. The semi-qualitative assessment of apoptosis cell expression is based on Table-1 [23,24].
The sliced ovarian tissue was deparaffinated with xylene thrice for 3 min each. The preparations were rehydrated using 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 70% ethanol and finally using water for 1 min and then soaked in a peroxidase blocking solution at 27oC for 10 min. The preparations were incubated with H and E for 3 min and washed with running water. Then, the preparations were cleaned and dropped with mounting media and covered with a coverslip. Follicular development was observed on the cells using a light microscope with 400x, which was previously confirmed at 1000x [25,26].
For the difference analysis between the negative control, positive control, and treatment groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used in normally distributed data, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used if the distribution was not normal. The expression of TNFR1 and apoptosis of granulosa cells were analyzed using ANOVA and post hoc test because the distribution was normal. The number of primary, secondary, tertiary, and graafian follicles was determined and examined using the Kruskal-Wallis test because the distribution was not normal.
This study consisted of three stages: Stem cell preparation, endometriosis model production, and proving the effects of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on TNFR1 expression, granulosa cell apoptosis, and folliculogenesis repair. In the stem cell preparation stage, the expression of negative CD45 and positive CD73, CD90, and CD105 was characterized to ensure that the stem cells transplanted were mesenchymal. Then, to prove that the stem cells that we transplanted were homing into the ovary, we looked at PKH26 luminescence. In the second stage, to prove the evidence of the endometriosis model, we euthanized the seven mice in the T1, T2, and T0 groups on day 14.
Stem cells were collected from bone marrow aspirates from the tibia bone of the mice, and then, the stem cells were isolated according to the procedure in the stem cell laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Disease, Universitas Airlangga. When the cells were 80% confluent, half of the cells were planted back into a new Petri dish with the same medium for expansion. The passage is performed every 5 days until it reaches passage four. An overview of bone marrow stem cell culture is shown in Figure-1.
Stem cells developed in vitro can be identified using genotype (nucleotide) and phenotypic approaches. In vitro stem cells were characterized based on phenotypes by the immunocytochemical approach, using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that are labeled with fluorescence isothiocyanate (FITC) (F3651; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). In this study, mesenchymal stem cells were phenotypically identified by the immunocytochemical approach using monoclonal antibodies labeled with FITC. The cell markers CD73, CD90, and CD105 were checked to confirm mesenchymal stem cells and CD45 to remove bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (Figure-2).
Using a fluorescence microscope, immunofluorescence examination results showed a positive expression of CD73 (Figure-2). CD73 is a marker of mesenchymal stem cells. CD90 is also a marker of mesenchymal stem cells, and in this study, the cultured stem cells showed positive CD90 expression. No green luminescence was observed because the cultured stem cells did not express CD45 (Figure-2). PKH26 luminescence was observed in the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell membrane (Figure-3), so the cells emitted red when observed under a fluorescence microscope. This is solid evidence that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can be homing in the ovarian tissue.
Immunohistochemical examination was intended to determine the expression of TNFR1 in the ovaries. The data resulting from this examination were semi-quantitative, assessed according to the modified Remmele method [27]. The Remmele scale index (immunoreactive score [IRS]) is the result of multiplying the percentage score of immunoreactive cells with the color intensity score on immunoreactive cells (Figure-4). The data for each sample are the average of the observed IRS value at five fields of view at 400x, which has been previously confirmed at 1000x.
After obtaining the IRS means, the data normality test was then conducted. Because the data were normally distributed, to determine the difference in the TNFR1 variable between groups, one-way ANOVA was used.
The expression of TNFR1 was significantly different among the three groups (p<0.05), so a further statistical examination was conducted using ANOVA. The post hoc test was used in this study because the variants of the three groups were not homogeneous. The post hoc test showed that the T1 group was significantly different from the T0 group (p<0.038) and the T2 group (p<0.017), but no significant difference was observed between the T0 and T2 groups (p>0.626) (Table-2). This study showed that endometriosis could increase TNF- R1 expression (T1) and administration of stem cells (T2) could reduce TNF- R1 expression similar to the control group (T0).
To determine the expression of apoptosis in granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles of mice, a histopathological examination was performed. The data for each sample were assessed semi-quantitatively according to the modified Remmele method (Figure-5). All these examinations used a Nikon H600L light microscope equipped with a 300 megapixel DS Fi2 digital camera and the Nikon Image System image processing software.
The IRS apoptosis data after the normality test showed that the data are normally distributed, so the data were analyzed using ANOVA. The apoptotic values of the three groups were significantly different (p<0.05), so a further statistical analysis using ANOVA was necessary. The post hoc test showed that the T0 group was significantly different from the T1 group (p<0.00), but no significant difference was observed between the T0 and T2 groups (p>0.19). Meanwhile, a significant difference was observed between the T1 and T2 groups (p<0.00) (Table-3).
To determine the number of primary, secondary, tertiary, and graafian follicles in the ovaries of mice, H & E staining was performed. The data on each sample were quantitative, where the number of follicles was counted in 400x. All these examinations used a Nikon H600L light microscope equipped with a calibrated micrometer, Nikon Image System image processing software, and a 300 megapixel DS Fi2 digital camera.
The statistical test results on the number of primary and secondary follicles between the three groups were not significantly different (p>0.05). The grade of folliculogenesis (tertiary follicles) among the three groups was not significantly different (p>0.05), whereas the graafian follicles showed significant differences among the three groups (p<0.05). The results of post hoc test on the graafian follicles showed that the T0 group was not significantly different from the T2 group (p>0.146), but a significant difference was observed between the T0 and T1 groups (p<0.005). Meanwhile, the number of graafian follicles between the T1 and T2 groups was significantly different (p<0.009) (Tables-4 and 5).
The results of characterization in this study showed that the expression of CD73, CD90, and CD105 was positive, proving that stem cells originating from the bone marrow after culture grew into mesenchymal stem cells. The characterization test was performed to prove that the cultured stem cells are true mesenchymal stem cells using at least three antibodies (i.e. CD73, CD90, and CD105); this is to ensure that what grows is mesenchymal stem cells. The results of the study showed that some mesenchymal stem cells grow (Figures-2-4). Meanwhile, CD45, which is an antibody that can identify hematopoietic stem cells, was used as a positive control. In this study, the cultured stem cells did not express CD45 (Figure-2) [28-30].
Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells whose capacity is functionally determined based on their ability to renew themselves and differentiate into several cell types. Mesenchymal stem cells can be isolated from various tissues, such as the bone marrow and skin. Markers on the surface of mesenchymal cells isolated from the skin, such as CD105, CD90, CD73, CD44, and CD200, can be found using immune fluorescence methods. Meanwhile, the presence of CD105, CD90, and CD73 can also be confirmed using flow cytometry [28-30].
The apoptosis of granulosa cells increases with the severity of the endometriosis. Granulosa cell apoptosis can also affect oocyte quality, which, in turn, will reduce the fertilization rate and reduce the pregnancy success rate [3]. The effects of endometriosis on granulosa cells have been described as change in steroidogenesis and cell cycle and increase in apoptosis. Endometriosis caused the dysregulation of molecular pathways in the development and growth of granulosa cells [31]. Endometriosis may alter various factors presented in follicular fluid by modifying the follicular oxidative stress status [32,33]. An increase in oxidative stress has been recently confirmed as the culprit of spindle disruption. Spindle disruption was an indicator of oxidative DNA damage, which leads to granulosa cell apoptosis [34]. Endometriosis also altered intrafollicular levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Follicular fluids from follicles aspirated from patients with endometriosis showed significantly higher concentrations of IL-8 and IL-12, which contribute to decreasing oocyte quality [35]. Higher concentrations of inflammatory ILs observed in patients with endometriosis may contribute to the disruption of the oocyte spindle [32].
Stem cells have great potential as a therapy for various diseases. Stem cells have a broad regeneration capacity and the ability to produce daughter cells, which will undergo further differentiation. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are adult stem cells derived from the bone marrow stroma. Mesenchymal stem cells can be used for cell therapy because they are easy to isolate, can be expanded widely without losing their differentiation ability, have low immunity, and are multipotent. The main role of mature stem cells is maintaining and repairing the tissue in which they are located [36]. Mesenchymal stem cells provide benefits through two mechanisms: (1) Mesenchymal stem cells differentiate to replace damaged cells to form new cytoarchitecture and (2) mesenchymal stem cells produce paracrine effects by releasing immunoregulators that support regeneration (tropic activity). One of the tropic activities of stem cells is inhibiting apoptosis.
The term """"homing"""" can be defined as a process by which stem cells migrate and then stick firmly to the tissue. The distribution of stem cells to the tissues/organs is the first step that must be achieved so that stem cells can repair damaged tissues/organs. For that, we need a way so that the transplanted stem cells can reach the target tissue/organ [37].
In this study, to ensure that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells reach the ovary as the target organ, they were stained and transplanted in all endometriosis mouse models. Two weeks after stem cell transplantation, the mice were euthanized, and their ovaries were removed. Mesenchymal stem cell colonization was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope [38].
TNF- is an important cytokine regulator, which not only regulates the immune response but also influences cell differentiation, cell survival, and cell apoptosis. The effects caused by TNF- depend on its binding to the receptor. TNF- binding with death receptors (TNFR1) on the cell membrane will induce an apoptotic pathway. The ovaries of mice express both TNF- receptors. In endometriosis, both types of receptors are also found in high concentrations.
Studies have shown that transplanting human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) can reduce the production of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6. hAEC can reduce TNF-, which is a mediator of apoptosis, thus, hAEC can inhibit apoptosis. The results of this study showed a decrease in the expression of TNFR1 (Table-6). This decrease causes the bond between TNFR1 and its ligands to weaken so that the apoptotic pathway does not work, which is prominent with a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic granulosa cells [39].
The decrease in the expression of TNFR1 in this study was only 19.5% against the incidence of apoptosis. This could be because mesenchymal stem cells also reduce the expression of their ligands (TNF-) so that ligand and receptor binding does not occur, and then, the apoptotic pathway does not occur. This will interfere with folliculogenesis in terms of decreasing the number of pre-ovulatory follicles, the size of the dominant follicles, and the levels of estradiol. This is due to the increased apoptosis of granulosa cells in endometriosis [10].
Granulosa cells are responsible for steroidogenesis and oocyte maturation. Folliculogenesis is a process of follicular development in the ovaries, which involves several processes: Recruitment, selection, growth, maturation, and ovulation. The stages of folliculogenesis are divided into two. The first phase is the pre-antral phase or gonadotropin-independent phase, characterized by the growth and differentiation of the oocytes. The second phase is the antral phase or gonadotropin-dependent phase, characterized by an increase in the size of the follicle itself. The pre-antral phase is controlled primarily by locally produced growth factors through the autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Meanwhile, the antral phase is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).
The dominant follicle is characterized by continuous granulosa cell mitosis. The selection of the dominant follicle begins at the end of the luteal phase of the previous cycle. FSH levels begin to rise near the end of the luteal phase, along with decreasing levels of progesterone and estrogen. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that FSH directly stimulates human granulosa cell mitosis. Granulosa cells are the only cells that can express FSH receptors. The binding of FSH with its receptors in the transmembrane will cause the expression of the P450 aromatase gene and 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which contribute to the production of estradiol. P450 aromatase contributes to the conversion of androgen to estrogen. At the end of the follicular phase, the intrafollicular concentration of estradiol is directly related to follicle size and reaches a concentration of +1 g/mL when the circulating estradiol level reaches its peak. Estradiol levels that reach their peak in the circulation will cause a surge in LH that triggers ovulation. FSH receptor signaling increases the expression of the LH receptor gene in granulosa cells. LH receptors cause granulosa cells in the dominant follicle to respond to an increase in LH mid-cycle and cause ovulation [40].
In bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in endometriosis mouse models, the number of primary and secondary follicles was higher in the group that received stem cells, although not statistically different, whereas the number of tertiary follicles did not differ between groups with and without stem cells. Transplanting stem cells significantly increase the number of graafian follicles; therefore, stem cell transplantation can improve folliculogenesis by reducing the apoptosis of granulosa cells so that the steroidogenesis and oogenesis functions are back to normal and increase the ovulation rate.
The transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in endometriosis mouse models can reduce the expression of TNFR1 and apoptosis of granulosa cells and improve folliculogenesis.

Ovarian endometriosis (endometriomas) is a common gynecological disease that occurs up to 10% of reproductive women and the prevalence of disease is up to 20 to 50% in infertile women [1-3]. The clinical presentations include pelvic pain, progressive dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and subfertility. The presence of endometriomas has the potential to destroy healthy ovarian tissues that leads to decreased ovarian function [4], problems with ovulation [5], and primary ovarian insufficiency [6]. The most effective treatment for endometriotic cyst is controversial. The first-line management of endometriotic cyst, a diameter larger than 3 cm, is a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy [7]. Moreover, management of endometrioma larger than 3 cm in women who have an infertility problem should consist of ovarian cystectomy prior to assisted reproductive technologies to improve pelvic pain or help perform the oocyte retrieval procedure without difficulties [8]. Although laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy provides the lowest recurrence and the highest chance of spontaneous pregnancy rate, risk of significant ovarian injury can occur. Ovarian injury is thought to be caused by loss of healthy ovarian follicles during surgery and inflammation caused by surgical trauma or vascular injury. Recent data have demonstrated that surgical treatment of endometriotic cyst have an adverse effect on ovarian reserve [9]. Inadvertent removal of normal ovarian tissue is one of the reasons for the reduction in ovarian reserve during cystectomy [10]. Serum anti-M""""ullerian hormone (AMH) is the most reliable and practical measurable marker for ovarian reserve [11]. This hormone reflects the number of high-quality oocytes within the ovaries. AMH is secreted by granulosa cells in women of reproductive age. Several studies have demonstrated a decrease in AMH levels after laparoscopic cystectomy of endometriomas [12-14]. In our study, AMH was used to evaluate ovarian reserve. The advantage of AMH over other ovarian serum markers is fairly constant levels, and hormone levels can be measured on any day of the menstrual cycle. AMH levels are reliable for predicting fertility and helping physicians identify women at risk of premature ovarian insufficiency [15, 16].
Many gynecologists try to find strategies to preserve ovarian function. We hypothesized that if a decrease in blood loss during surgery occurs, the surgeon could view the operative field clearly and could perform the operation smoothly with less use of bipolar coagulation. As a result, vascular and healthy ovarian tissue damage would be decreased. In the present study, we use tranexamic acid (TXA) as a pharmacological tool for reducing bleeding during surgery. TXA has been widely used during surgery to decrease bleeding and wound complications [17-19]. The recommended standard dose is 1 g every 6 to 8 h in general fibrinolysis [20]. However, the dose could be increased in case of excessive bleeding but should not exceed a maximum daily dose of 4 g [21].
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial in terms of design and procedures (such as recruitment rate, retention, safety of intravenous 1 g of TXA, and sample size verification) and assess TXA efficacy on ovarian reserve and intra-operative blood loss by comparing the mean difference of AMH levels between TXA and control groups. AMH was measured pre- and at 3 months post-surgery.
This study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted between May 2019 and November 2020. The study was approved by the Ethical Clearance Committee on Human Related to Researches Involving Human Subjects and Faulty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital Mahidol University (No. MURA2019/245) and was registered on the Thai Clinical Trial Registry (TCTR). This study was conducted in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration.
Reproductive women ages 19-45 years who were planning to undergo laparoscopic cystectomy for unilateral or bilateral endometriotic cysts were invited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria included several parameters: (1) unilateral/bilateral endometriotic cyst with typical ultrasonography characteristics [22], (2) ovarian cyst size 3-10 cm, (3) no previous use of oral hormones 3 months prior to the study, (4) no history of taking depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate or gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist within 9 months prior to the study, and (5) willingness to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria included several parameters: (1) pregnancy and post-menopausal status, (2) history of allergy or contraindications to TXA, (3) underlying disease, such as thromboembolic disease, which contradicts the use of TXA, (4) pre-operative AMH level < 0.5 ng/ml, and/or (5) history of previous ovarian surgical intervention. Eligible participants were enrolled in the present study and signed the consent forms. The participants were randomly assigned either: (1) TXA and (2) untreated or control. Blocks of four were randomized with a 1:1 ratio by an independent nurse and concealed in a labeled envelope. Serum samples were collected before laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. For the intervention group, TXA 1 g intravenously was administered by anesthesiologists within 10 min before making skin incision. Surgeons were blinded to the participant groups. Laparoscopic surgery was performed with the standard operating procedure by the endoscopic staff in the Ramathibodi hospital. All surgeons (n = 5) had comparable surgical skills and experience with laparoscopy. Briefly, after general anesthesia was administered, the participants laid in the Trendelenburg position. The primary trocar was placed at the umbilicus with 2 to 3 accessory ports. Ovarian cystectomy was initiated by an incision over the wall of ovarian cyst through the cortex. The cyst wall was mobilized by sharp and blunt dissection and removed from the ovarian cortex. The inner ovarian stroma was coagulated with bipolar electrocautery (20-30 W current) to achieve satisfactory hemostasis and approximation. The ovarian cortex was closed with an absorbable suture (2-0 or 3-0). Blood loss was calculated by anesthesiologists as the difference between the total amounts of suction and irrigation. All intra- and post-operative complications occurring within 3 months of the operation were recorded. The participants were scheduled for follow-up appointments at 3 months post-surgery. Sera were collected for measurement of post-surgery AMH levels.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial in terms of several parameters: (1) recruitment rate, (2) successful completion of the study procedures, (3) safety of intravenous 1 g of TXA, and (4) verification of the sample size calculation for the full RCT using intravenous 1 g of TXA on ovarian function preservation in patient who undergoing ovarian cystectomy. Recruitment and successful completion rate observed in the pilot which are considered feasible for the full RCT were not less than 90% of all eligible patients and 95% of all enrolled patients, respectively. Safety of intravenous 1 g of TXA is defined as no serious adverse drug reaction (ADR). Serious ADR denoted as any unfavorable medical occurrence that at 1 g TXA: (i) resulted in death; or (ii) was life-threatening; or (iii) prolonged hospital stay; or (iv) resulted in significant handicap; or (v) required medical or surgical intervention to prevent a permanent defect of a body function or structure; or (vi) was a malignancy or a congenital anomaly [23].
The secondary objectives included assessments of TXA efficacy on ovarian reserve and intra-operative blood loss by comparing mean difference of AMH levels between TXA and control groups. AMH was assessed pre-operatively and at 3 months post-surgery. AMH was quantified using an electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA; Elecsys(R) AMH assay, Roche Diagnostics) by a technician who was unaware of participant allocation.
The intended sample size for the present study had been estimated using a formula calculated based on the probability of observing problems occurring in target study subjects with a chosen level of confidence. P(x > 0) = 1 - (1 - )^n. Where x indicates as number of participants (of the n participant). The formula is: n = ln(1 - )/ln(1 - ) if  designates the problem probability and  denotes certain threshold of confidence by 100% x  (such as 95% CI,  is 0.95) [24, 25]. The calculator is available at http://www.pilotsamplesize.com).
The lowest recruitment rate approximately 5-10% with at 95% confidence interval was used to calculate for the present study. Twenty-eight to 58 participants were needed for the unsuccessful recruitment rate of 5-10%. We chose 40 participants to enroll in the present study and estimated that it would require 15 months, including a 3-month follow-up, to complete the study.
Software program SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for statistical analysis. The Pearson's chi-square and Student's t tests were applied to compare categorical and continuous parametric data, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare nonparametric continuous data, that is, serum AMH levels before and after surgery and the difference in AMH levels (pre- and 3-month post-surgery). P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. The median difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) of difference were calculated by Stata Statistical Software: Release 15.0 (College Station, TX, USA) and Hodges-Lehmann median methods. (https://www.real-statistics.com/non-parametric-tests/mann-whitney-test/mann-whitney-median-confidence-interval/)
Enrollment took place from May 2019 through August 2020, and the 3-month follow-up was completed in November 2020. The timeline for recruitment was delayed by 4 months because of the start of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Thailand. The operations for benign conditions, which included laparoscopic cystectomy, were temporarily halted for 4 months in our hospital. Of the total 42 participants who were invited to participate in this study, 40 participants were recruited and randomized into two groups. The recruitment rate was 95%. All of them completed a 3-month follow-up, as shown in Fig 1. We made a phone call to the participants if they missed the follow-up day and invited them to visit on the next day. The rate of successful completion of the study procedures was 100%.
The baseline demographic characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. The two groups were similar in mean age, body mass index, parity, the maximum diameter of ovarian cyst, laterality of lesions, and American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) stage of endometriotic cyst. The surgical outcomes were compared in treatment and control groups. Estimated blood loss, post-operative complications, and length of hospital stay were all similar in the two groups. However, operating time in TXA group was longer than in the control group. Pre-operative AMH levels were also similar between patients in the TXA and control groups (2.9 +/- 1.5 and 2.4 +/- 1.8 ng/ml, respectively) as shown in Table 2. At 3 months post-surgery, serum AMH levels of the TXA and control groups decreased significantly. Means difference of pre- and 3-month post-operative AMH of TXA and control groups were 0.89 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.38) ng/ml and 0.83 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.37) ng/ml, respectively (Table 3). However, the mean difference of serum AMH level (pre-and 3-month post-surgery) between the TXA and control groups was not significantly different (0.05; 95% CI - 0.65 to 0.76). The mean difference in serum AMH level (pre-and 3-month post-surgery) was 0.7 +/- 1.2 and 0.8 +/- 1.0 ng/ml in the control and TXA groups, respectively (Table 2). No post-operative complications or adverse effects were found, and none of the participants required a blood transfusion.
In our study, we analyzed the outcomes between unilateral and bilateral ovarian cysts. There were no significant differences in the mean difference of AMH levels (pre- and 3-month post-operation) between unilateral and bilateral ovarian cysts (- 0.61; 95%CI - 1.32 to 0.11). Moreover, operating time was significantly longer in patients with bilateral ovarian cysts than those with unilateral ovarian cysts, as shown in Table 4. We also analyzed subgroups consisting of pre- and 3-month post-surgery AMH levels by comparing control and TXA groups for each unilateral and bilateral ovarian cyst group. The mean difference of AMH levels in the TXA and control groups in women with unilateral ovarian cyst was not significantly different (0.06, 95%CI - 0.86 to 0.98). Operating time and blood loss were not significantly different between TXA and control groups as shown in Table 5. The mean difference in AMH levels in the TXA and control groups in women with bilateral ovarian cyst was not significantly different (0.22, 95%CI - 0.98 to 1.42). Operating times and blood loss were also not significantly different between TXA and control groups as shown in Table 6.
We then performed the statistical calculation for power from our results using the mean difference between pre- and post-surgery AMH levels and SD for TXA and control groups were 0.8 +/- 0.1 and 0.7 +/- 1.2, respectively. The power was only 4.2% (www.openepi.com). We also calculated the sample size for future full-scale randomized control studies addressing the effects of TXA on ovarian reserve during laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy for endometrioma with the formula comparing two means. Our revised sample size calculation verified 1915 experimental and 1915 control participants to allow for rejection of the null hypothesis with probability (power) 0.8 and type I error probability of 0.05. With a 10% allowance for dropouts, the total sample size would be 4214.
The present pilot study demonstrated that conducting a large randomized double-blind controlled trial would be feasible with some modifications. Our results do not rule out the benefit of the administration of intravenous TXA immediately before laparoscopic cystectomy in patients with endometriotic cysts. TXA seems beneficial for blood loss when we analyzed subgroups of unilateral and bilateral ovarian cyst patients. However, several modifications should be made to improve feasibility, such as increasing the TXA dosage, modifying TXA administration, studying women either with unilateral or bilateral ovarian cysts, increasing the follow-up interval, and examining other outcomes, e.g., ease of surgery and surgeon's satisfaction.
The present study's recruitment and retention rate was high because TXA administration is quite a safe intervention and could be theoretically beneficial to patients. The follow-up time after surgery is short, and follow-up visits are often needed to prevent the recurrence of the disease. These factors could increase the willingness of patients to come back for follow-up appointments. The delay in recruitment in the present study was unavoidable because of the global pandemic.
The laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriotic cysts caused a decrease in ovarian reserve at 3 months after surgery. Results from our study were similar to the others [26-28]. The proposed mechanisms for decreasing ovarian reserve include inadvertent removal of normal ovarian tissue during cystectomy and thermal injury. Ovarian parenchymal tissue and primordial follicle of normal ovarian tissue were observed in the specimens collected from the surgeries [29, 30]. Electrocauterization, such as bipolar electrosurgery, which is often used to control bleeding during laparoscopic cystectomy, could damage ovarian follicles [31].
Several strategies have been reported to prevent ovarian reserve decline after laparoscopic ovarian surgery, including different surgical techniques, chemical agents, and medications [32-34]. Ovarian cystectomy reduced ovarian reserve after surgery more than ovarian ablation (or vaporization) and deroofing; however, cyst recurrence was found more often in patients treated with ovarian ablation and deroofing than cystectomy [26, 35]. A systematic review involving 1047 patients demonstrated that laparoscopic ovarian suture preserved ovarian function more than bipolar electrosurgery did. A hemostatic sealant agent was superior to bipolar coagulation. Ultrasonic electrosurgery was equal to bipolar coagulation [36]. However, studies of the effect of TXA on ovarian reserve in laparoscopic cystectomy, have not been previously reported.
TXA is widely used to decrease blood loss in many situations. TXA (trans-4-(Aminomethyl) cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine that competitively inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin and is a competitive inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator. It inhibits the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen, resulting in inhibition of plasminogen activation and fibrin binding to plasminogen and, therefore, leads to impairment of fibrinolysis. High doses of TXA reduce plasmin formation [37]. Many strong pieces of evidence demonstrate that TXA causes a reduction in blood loss during major surgery. A large systematic review of several RCTs in 10,488 surgical patients comparing TXA/no TXA administration (placebo) demonstrated that TXA contributes to a reduction in approximately one-third of blood transfusion requirements [19]. The dosage of TXA for local fibrinolysis treatment is 0.5 to 1 g (equivalent to 15 mg/kg) by intravenous injection every 6 to 8 h while the dosage for general fibrinolysis treatment is a single dose of 1 g or 10 mg/kg by intravenous injection [38]. The meta-analysis by Heyns et al. suggested that the most frequently used single dose for a reduction of perioperative estimated blood loss in several types of operation was 15 mg/kg [39]. A study by Abbasi et al. compared two doses of TXA, i.e., 5 and 15 mg/kg during sinus endoscopy surgery [40]. The study demonstrated that the administration of TXA 15 mg/kg reduced more blood loss and more surgeons satisfied surgical field than those of TXA 5 mg/kg. Therefore, the single dose of TXA 1 g (equivalent to 15 to 20 mg/kg) was selected to explore in the present study. However, a single dose of TXA up to 100 mg/kg had been reported in coronary artery surgery [41].
The present study did not demonstrate any beneficial effect of TXA for reducing blood loss. Blood loss from the use TXA was less than that in control but not significantly different (50 vs 60 ml). The possible explanation for the different results when compared to the previous meta-analysis could be the smaller amount of blood loss in the present study. Because the amount of blood loss was small (only 50-60 ml), consequently, the difference of amount blood loss between TXA and the control group was even smaller and difficult to assess precisely. Moreover, the laterality of the ovarian cyst could have interfered with the results. In general, patients with unilateral ovarian cystectomy showed less blood loss during surgery than bilateral procedures.
Our study was the first report to evaluate the benefit of TXA on ovarian reserve, which administered before laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy by measured mean difference AMH level preoperative and 3 months after surgery. We did not find that intra-operative TXA can help preserve ovarian function. Although the sample size of the present study was small, our revised sample size calculation verified 4214 participants to allow for rejection of the null hypothesis. Therefore, it is very unlikely that future study could be conducted with an enormous sample size, even studying in multi-centers.
Ovarian laterality is a significant factor impacting ovarian reserve in patients undergoing cystectomy. Based on previous studies, bilateral cystectomy was statistically associated with a significant reduction in AMH levels and ovarian reserve compared to the unilateral cystectomy group [28, 42]. However, our study demonstrated a decrease in serum AMH levels post-surgery more in the bilateral than in the unilateral cysts, but these results did not present a significant difference. This finding could have occurred because the sample size was not calculated according to laterality. Few side effects of TXA have ever been reported [37], which is consistent with our study.
The strengths of the study were evaluated. Our study was a pioneer and a double-blinded RCT study, and surgeons with the same experience levels performed the surgery. Our study had limitations, including short-term follow-up and no assessment of other ovarian reserve markers (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], inhibin-B) or sonographic markers. The present study results will help guide future studies of ovarian reserve reduction prevention during ovarian surgery in terms of optimal dosage and administration methods of tranexamic acid, laterality of ovarian cysts, and other outcome variables, e.g., surgeons' satisfaction and ease of the operation.
The results from the present study support the feasibility of conducting the full RCT for the intravenous TXA administration during laparoscopic cystectomy for endometrioma. Several modifications should be added to achieve the full RCT, such as increasing the TXA dose, focusing on patient subgroups (either with unilateral or bilateral ovarian cysts), exploring surgeons' satisfaction, and follow-up periods longer than 3 months."

However, whether iron overload caused by ectopic periodic bleeding found in patients with endometriosis participates in endometriosis-associated reproductive failure is unknown. This study aimed to investigate effects of iron at level relevant to pelvic iron overload on the development of preimplantation mouse embryo. Two-cell embryos were collected, and cultured to blastocysts in G1/G2 medium supplemented with iron alone or in combination with iron chelator. The development rates, ATP level, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species level (ROS), and apoptotic and ferroptotic indices were compared between control and iron treatments across each specific developmental stage. Prolonged exposure to iron remarkably impaired early embryo development in vitro by hampering blastocyst formation (P < 0.001), which could be partly restored by iron chelator (P < 0.001). The arrest of embryo development was linked with iron-initiated mitochondrial dysfunction with reduction of ATP generation and MMP (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Impaired mitochondria altered ROS accumulation post-iron exposure at morula stage and blastocyst stage (P < 0.05). Moreover, Iron-exposed blastocyst stage embryos showed higher apoptotic and ferroptotic rates (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Our results highlight that pathologically relevant level of iron compromises preimplantation mouse embryo development by disrupting mitochondrial function and triggering both apoptosis and ferroptosis, which implicates that excess iron found in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis likely participates in endometriosis-associated reproductive failure.",
